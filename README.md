# Varela Digital

Varela Digital is a digital scholarly editing project focused on the *Coleção Varela*, published in volume II of the *Anais do Arquivo Histórico do Rio Grande do Sul*. The project aims to provide a structured, interoperable, and methodologically transparent digital edition of nineteenth-century documents, primarily correspondence related to the Farroupilha Revolution.

The edition is based on TEI P5 encoding and adopts a layered architecture that clearly separates textual encoding, structural transformation, presentation, and semantic enrichment. This separation ensures that the TEI documents remain the sole authoritative source, while different outputs can be generated in a reproducible and non-redundant way.

At its current stage, the project includes a pilot corpus of approximately 250 documents and serves as the basis for a Master’s thesis in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (University of Bologna).

The project includes an XSLT stylesheet designed to transform TEI P5 documents into static HTML representations. This transformation is intentionally minimal and non-interpretative. Its purpose is to provide a readable and structurally faithful HTML rendering of each document, serving both as a fallback view and as a validation layer for the TEI encoding. The XSLT focuses on preserving the internal structure of the documents, including headings, paragraphs, lists, page breaks, and figures, while exposing existing document types and attributes without adding semantic interpretation or interactivity.

XSLT stylesheets cannot be executed on their own and require an external XSLT processor. Since the stylesheet used in Varela Digital relies on XSLT 2.0 features, a processor that supports this version of the specification is required. The project uses Saxon-HE (Home Edition), a widely adopted open-source XSLT processor that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and supports XSLT 2.0 and 3.0. The Saxon-HE JAR file is not included in the repository and must be downloaded separately and placed locally in the directory `tools/saxon/saxon-he.jar`. This file is intentionally excluded from version control, as it is an external tool and not part of the scholarly content of the project.

To generate static HTML files for the entire corpus, the project provides a batch transformation script. This script applies the same XSLT stylesheet to all TEI files located in the directory `data/documents_XML/` and produces one HTML file per document in the directory `data/documents_HTML/`. This batch process ensures reproducibility and transparency, while keeping derived outputs separate from the authoritative TEI source files.
