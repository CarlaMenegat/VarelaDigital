  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nSince I arrived here on the 5th of this month, I have been assiduously working to complete 350 jackets, the same number of pants and shirts, and 450 ponchos for this division, requisitioning 100 additional ponchos for my legion, knowing its condition, etc.; and despite my efforts, I have obtained nothing, so to speak; the cause of this remains with me, so as not to spark quarrels. I requested six contos, which I was commanded to be paid in copper, of which I have barely received 2:5008$000 réis; nevertheless, on this occasion, I send to you, under the conduct of our superior commanding Colonel, the following: in four cases of folded Bris — silver by the value of the stamp Rs. 1:366$400 — 9 ounces of gold at nominal value, being 5 at 28$500 and 4 at 308 réis each. In 5 boxes, marked — Almeida 50 fine ponchos 115 coats, being 74 crimson and 41 green 146 blue baize pants 200 shirts\n\nThe rest of the money, which I will exchange, as well as the clothing being made, on Wednesday, the 18th of this month, will follow me towards Pelotas, where I believe we will meet; the nine ounces go in the case marked X.\n\nMay God keep Your Lordship  \nPorto Alegre, May 14, 1836  \nDomingos José de Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Antônio de Sousa Neto  \nColonel Commander of the 1st Liberal Division"
