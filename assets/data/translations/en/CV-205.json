  "translation": "Bernardina\n\nIf I still remember correctly, your plan when you left here was to go to the house of Senhor José Rodrigues Chaves, and from there immediately go to one of the estates of Manuel Gonçalves or Ramirez, since Senhor Raimundo Senandes offered himself to assist you in everything you might need. Either of these places seems good to me, because as soon as I can leave for there I will go, and then to Uruguay, where I intend to establish my residence. Today they told me you were going to Uncle Luís, and I believed it because of the direction of the journey. This does not suit us in any way; therefore, it is still time for you to follow where I wish. You have your brother Bernardino, now also Paraguay, and even your godfather João, as soon as he knows that there is a place to dispose of the leathers such as Cerro Largo, and besides this I am sure that on the way they will escort you, if necessary.\n\nHugs to our children and regards to the godmothers, godfathers, and siblings. Your husband who loves you very much  \nPelotas, October 20, 1836.  \nAlmeida"
