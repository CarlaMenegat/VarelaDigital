  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nOn the 6th of the current month, dated the same, I received an official letter from Your Lordship regarding Serra dos Tapes, on the left of the Arroio de Pelotas, and, to comply with your orders, on the 7th I went to the residence of the citizen Serafim Pereira Rosa, who without any doubt offered to hand over to me the instructions currently in my possession; and in this way I believe I have done what I ought, thus avoiding violence against the heads of families, cutting off the intrigue which lacked nothing to reach its peak. The instructions that I see I cannot carry out in some articles, due to the impossibility of the inhabitants existing in the district, and it is necessary that Your Lordship\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nAndrade, 8th of July, 1836  \nMost Illustrious Sir  \nDomingos José de Almeida, Colonel Chief of the Legion.  \nJoão Alexandre, Police Officer."
