  "translation": "My dear husband of my heart  \nPelotas, February 3, 1836.\n\nI received yours by Mr. Captain Manuel Antunes, which I greatly appreciated, your health; as I have a bearer for this one in the same way I write to you, wishing to take advantage of the bearer in order to inform you that everyone is in perfect health, but longing for your absence, and I even more, for you well know the esteem I have for your amiable company and therefore I earnestly ask you to strive to preserve a life that is the thing I hold in greatest regard in this world; and besides this, engrave in your mind that we have children and that your absence would be of great harm to them, therefore caution and more caution; and I remain calm in the persuasion that my pleas will be heeded.\n\nI have felt greatly lacking your news, of which I do not know the cause, but if it is not so. Accept many longings from our godfather José Félix, my parents, and godfather Rolino, as well as our children.\n\nMr. Captain Manuel Antunes has urged the President so that he may go there to take office; it has not been possible to convince him for now because of Ribas and others as far as I understand. Today, the people from the coast gather to be ready until the second order from the said Sir.\n\nYour wife, very loving from the heart  \nBernardina\n\nNota bene Sir"
