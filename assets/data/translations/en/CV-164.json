  "translation": "My dear husband of my heart Pelotas, February 6, 1836.\n\nNow, at about 5 o’clock in the afternoon, with great pleasure, I received the letter you wrote me from Pedras Brancas on the 2nd of this month, informing me of your good health, which I am more than anything concerned about; except for always having my spirit agitated by these disorders, I am living in health, and our children likewise, whom I embrace on your behalf and ask for blessings.\n\nAraújo Ribeiro, they say for certain he is going there to take office; he certainly left today on the steamship for Rio Grande, where, despite the many advisors, just like the ones here, it will be decided that he will go, may God so permit, to see if we calm down and there is no greater disorder.\n\nWhat he agreed upon with Captain Antunes, you will know better from him, and therefore I say nothing about it. In the case that things take a better shape, good; however, I always think that we should not neglect the business you have in hand, for that is my entire wish, therefore, in case peace is reestablished, I hold that either you should come here soon, or send someone who in your name makes arrangements to your will; count on my will, which is all to see you calm and free from similar noise.\n\nUncle Boaventura, who prides himself on being the one who most endeavored for Araújo Ribeiro to go there to take office, today, I say yesterday, departed with his family embarked on a Luís de Azevedo.\n\nI will be observing and hearing something new, to share with you at the first occasion. I instructed João da Cunha that at this same time he should write to you about the affairs of our house, and therefore I say nothing about that. Receive regards from compadre José Félix. May God give you health and keep you as wishes your loving\n\n(a) Bernardina\n\nMr. Domingos José de Almeida. Porto Alegre."
