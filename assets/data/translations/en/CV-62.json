  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that Neto was in São José gathering men to beat me and pursue me, a police force I had placed in Encruzilhada. I managed to gather some horsemen and pursue them, traveling by night and ambushing along the paths, which allowed me to reach São José without being detected by the enemy's vanguards; but I no longer found him as he had passed Camaquã and headed towards Piratini. Yesterday a friend of mine arrived from outside who left Colonel Loureiro at the chapel of Santana with 900 men to join Aníbal with 200 men, who the next day was to assemble, and then intended to pursue Guedes, who was nearby with 500 men and had killed some rebel officers who held meetings for the rebels; a lieutenant from the rebels defected, and many horses and men have been gathered.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency  \nCordilheira, July 3, 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Manuel Jorge Rodrigues,  \nLieutenant-General Commander-in-Chief of the Army.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu,  \nLieutenant-Colonel.\n\nThe friend is João Silveira. The Lieutenant introduced is João Ferreira to Lieutenant-Colonel Francisco Pedro. It seems to refer again to Loureiro, according to the examination given to the bearer of the letter."
