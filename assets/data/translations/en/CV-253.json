  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, September 3, 1838.\n\nSince the last letter I received from you, I have not had the opportunity to write to you, which I am doing now. I cannot comprehend what is said in Belém about our slaves; but whatever God wills, if we live, all will be well.\n\nYesterday José Mariano de Matos arrived from Sandú, where he was with your brother João, who tells me he has earned a lot of money supplying Fructo, and that he is close to becoming the master of Montevideo soon, which, if it happens, perhaps Mr. Ramirez will not leave as he plans.\n\nI am getting a little better from the scabies; but I am so pressed with work that sometimes I don't know where my head is, and moreover I find myself with the Justice office and with the army remounts that will go into operation; I do not know if I will manage to gracefully leave the position: God help me!\n\nThe children are doing well, as are those there, whom you will embrace for me. Give regards to Mr. Chaves, his wife, godmother Carlota, Manuel Campis, and everyone in general; and receive you the heart of your Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. At Mr. José Rodrigues Chaves's house."
