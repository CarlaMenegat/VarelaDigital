  "translation": "My Most Excellent Sir,\n\nAs Your Excellency, Piratini, who ordered the remainder of my butchering slaves stationed in Montevideo to be disposed of, to send with their value to Assis 2:000$000, to Zambeccari 1:000$000, to our prisoners 1:000$000, payment to the Printing Press 3:852$800 of capital and premiums due until last December, to Ré 1:663$200 for the payment of paper and medicines that the State owes him, to Deal 384$000 on account of the same State, 480$ part of the amount of medicines purchased for the same State from Dr. Bocquin; I now also inform you that although I consider these slaves sold and their amount distributed, I will send today a counter-order, not of the sale of the slaves, because I count on them lost if Fructo continues under the oppression of the Orientals, but of their proceeds, given the direction our affairs have taken in recent days.\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s sincere and obliged friend, Almeida  \nSanta Catarina, March 31, 1839"
