  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir,\n\nRecognizing the government which, for the prompt consolidation of the republican system, which the great majority of the inhabitants of this State have solemnly proclaimed and sworn to defend, it is absolutely necessary to contract a loan, which, while ensuring advantageous profit to the bidders, meets the needs of the war without burdening the peoples already overtaxed, and even to avoid violent measures, although applicable in the current state of affairs, has entrusted me with promoting the said loan, as can be seen from the attached decree of May 29 last.\n\nFor this reason, I address Your Excellency for 5,000$000 rs. in silver or gold, which will be paid to you within the period set by the aforementioned decree with a premium of one and a half percent per month, which will begin to run from the day the document in due form is delivered to you at this Secretariat.\n\nTo the Treasury on this date, and indeed in this city, Your Excellency will send Your Excellency Piratini, June 9, 1837.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida.\n\nReceived on June 19 and replied on the same day and year 1837. Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic Most Illustrious Sir Tito Teixeira Pinto. From the Ministry of the Treasury."
