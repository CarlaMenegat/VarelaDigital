  "translation": "Dear Bernardina\n\nFortunately, I have had the opportunity to write to you almost every day, which partly eases the longing I constantly feel for you and our children. Even today I received your letter of the 28th of last month, which accompanied the sugar and flour you sent, and I know you have received the 808 réis from Bresque; I must also suppose that by now you are in possession of sixty patacões that I sent you from here. With that, I am more at ease, although I still desire that the amounts from Tavares, Benito (he must be the justice of the peace of Jaguarão, killed by a force under the command of Florisbelo de Ávila, from Silva Tavares' people), and Manuel Gonçalves be delivered to you.\n\nThrough this bearer, you will send me some documents that are in the drawer of the writing desk where I used to write, in its small drawer, underneath the mirror, such as the reply to the enclosed letter, which you will send to old Sousa by a trustworthy person to bring that reply.\n\nOur affairs are proceeding without news and as if stalled, which greatly pains me for the most advantageous opportunity offered to us to overthrow our enemies has been lost. Patience and perseverance, for everything will be resolved. I am waiting for Vicente, for whom I sent to bring the slaves that were at Pedras Brancas and at Dores; but if you find someone to bring the slaves to Montevideo before him, send them, so that we may begin to have means to raise and educate our children. Your parents and siblings are without news; Godmother María José and Quínzio went to Pelotas yesterday because godfather Joaquim wanted to seek medical treatment there; and all the children remained at Pedras Altas. I still think you would do well at Manuel Gonçalves' house, considering that Félix will take charge of our children's education.\n\nEmbrace them for me, give my regards to all relatives in general, and you receive the heart of your lover Almeida.\n\nPiratini, June 8, 1837.\n\nMadam Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. At Senhor Luís Vieira's farm, in Chuí."
