  "translation": "My dear old woman of my heart. Porto Alegre, April 25, 1835.\n\nThis is the fourth letter I have sent you, and I have truly felt the lack of receiving one from you, to know how you are and how our dear children are doing, whom I bless and embrace with the deepest longing. We have scarcely made progress in the three ordinary sessions, and I only await the opportunity to present a bill concerning the circulating medium, so that I may return. I have been very busy with favors, and that has taken up so much of my time that I have not even been able to look after the yacht, which is why Filipe is still going today. On the first yacht, send me 100 tongues. Again, I urge you to admonish godfather Rolino to be very vigilant with the slaves, to maintain harmony among them all, not to fail to receive cattle for grazing, even if for less than the usual rates, to keep watch over the manioc, and in the event of any shortfalls, to take care of the plantation on the small farm, following however primarily the instructions of cousin Cipriano. Send me a small bottle of Custódia's medicine and the recipe for making it, as it is for a fellow countryman of mine who has been very helpful to me and suffers from asthma.\n\nReceive, my esteemed old woman, the longing heart of your old lover who holds you in great esteem, Almeida.\n\nMadam Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida - Pelotas."
