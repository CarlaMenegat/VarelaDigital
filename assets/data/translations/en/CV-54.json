  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn compliance with the orders of Your Excellency Rio Guaíba above, I disembarked at ten o’clock at night at Ponta Rasa, and having already sent a detachment of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant Isaías Antônio Alz. to Faxinal to escort the war gunboat that had fallen into the hands of the rebels, under whose protection I was proceeding; but before that, still at night, I headed to Passo Fundo to attack a rebel force of about one hundred men commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tomás Pereira, but as he had already fearfully withdrawn from that position, and I learned that he had sent a detachment of about twenty men to the Passo do Pesqueiro to protect the passage and the convoy of some carts belonging to Antônio de Sousa Neto, general-in-chief of the anarchist forces, I immediately, on the same night, headed to said pass, not only to protect the detachment I had sent to retrieve the war gunboat at Faxinal but also to seize said carts; and indeed, before reaching Passo do Pesqueiro, at a distance of half a league, and before dawn, I encountered said carts with a guard of about twenty men, of whom two were killed due to greater resistance and thirteen taken prisoners, being ten soldiers, one sergeant faithful to the said Neto, and two black men belonging to the same; two carts from Neto’s kit and the officers of his picket, one a covered small cart and the other a large transport cart; six teams of tame oxen to drive them. All this I accomplished, Bataillon 2nd commanded by Brigadier Filipe Neri, as the other party remained at the Passo do Caí with its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Fernandes; and the gunboat having not yet arrived restored, although it had already moved down the river two and a half leagues by poles and tow, I sent another detachment by land to meet it; on this occasion I also requested Brigadier Filipe Neri to go by river in the steam boat with the force he commanded, which he promptly agreed to, and both forces met it moving at a distance of almost half a league from Passo do Pesqueiro.\n\nFrom there I marched to Passo do Caí, at Contrato, to deliver the prisoners to Lieutenant Colonel Fernandes, and continued with the carts to Ponta Rasa, picking up fifty cattle on the way, which, with the carts, I made to be transported by boat to the camp at Picada, where they are, all at the disposal of the order of Your Excellency. Neto’s office desk was found closed, a large chest and two small ones with clothing and some provisions, offices and more correspondence papers, six baskets belonging to his picket officers also with clothing and some provisions and papers; one and a half barrels of sugar, two barrels of wine, and some kitchen and table trinkets. His uniform of fine blue cloth embroidered with gold as general-in-chief of the rebels, a neat scarlet fine cloth hat chevron embroidered with gold with the legend of the Rio-Grandense Republican Army, a sash of cloth embroidered on the reverse side, a\n\nThis is all I have to present before Your Excellency. Camp of Picada, April 11, 1839. Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito. Francisco Pedro de Abreu. Major and Acting Commander of the 5th National Guard Corps."
