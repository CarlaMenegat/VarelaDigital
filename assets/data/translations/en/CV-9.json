  "translation": "Friend and Lord\n\nAntônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu requests discounts of dues on account of what the State owes him and so that the provisions made regarding payments are not frustrated, I ask you to tell me the total amount the State owes him; also the documents by which this account was justified, to see what can be promptly paid, in accordance with the same opinion and circular.\n\nYour friend and compatriot Fontoura\n\nWhen Abreu was here, he presented some documents of cattle taken from him for the supply of forces, and took them back because some questions were missing; I do not know how much they amounted to; he still owes a note issued at the Erval Collectory, recently presented by the collector there.\n\nFrom Your Excellency Martins\n\nAbreu brought the documents again; therefore, they were not recorded. The amount debited through the Erval Collectory, I do not recall what it is; and thus he is also debited with another amount, which he received by order of the Ministry of Finance through the Collectory in his charge, when Collector.\n\nAnnexed to document CV-6."
