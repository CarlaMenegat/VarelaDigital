  "translation": "My dear old one of my heart. Porto Alegre, June 20, 1835.\n\nThank God now, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, our legislative work is finished, and by the first vessel you shall have me there, if no unforeseen obstacle prevents otherwise.\n\nHugs to our children and greetings to your parents, godfather José Félix, your brothers, José Pedro, João da Cunha, and all at home, you receiving the heart of your old lover Almeida.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. City of Pelotas."
