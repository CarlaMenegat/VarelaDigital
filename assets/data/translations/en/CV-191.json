  "translation": "My dear Bernardina Porto Alegre, February 23, 1836.\n\nYour letters of the 3rd and 6th of this month, which I only received yesterday, have not dispelled the cares and afflictions caused by seeing you amidst a reckless horde, such as the one armed that tries, under the pretext of the possession of a frantic factionist, to overthrow the virtuous patriots who on September twentieth snatched our Province from the abyss to which the wicked intended to lead it, like those evil, equally degenerate Proteus of regression; but as I now consider Bento Gonçalves and his patriotic division, little by little I breathe more freely, etc., etc...\n\nPrepare yourself now to receive another blow, prepare yourself finally to know that we shall part for farther away and perhaps for more than two months.\n\nThe Chamber to which I belong, having resolved to send a delegation to Rio to expose to the Central Government the crooked and anarchic conduct of Araújo Ribeiro and to show the delicate state of the Province, appointed me and Dr. Marciano to such commission: I wished to excuse myself, but beginning by saying that although I found myself here, my heart was between you and our children, my voice failed me and a torrent of tears leaping from my eyes put me in a state of saying nothing until the end of the session. Many of my colleagues also wept, and leaving until yesterday my excuse, reasons appeared that force me to make this additional sacrifice for my fellow provincials, for you and our children. Yes; I go to Rio, and may my efforts be crowned in measure with my wishes. Comfort yourself, Bernardina, with the remembrance of the pure intentions that I nurture and that oblige me to such a prolonged and uncomfortable journey; a journey if not risky, at least thorny because of snares.\n\nSend me, immediately upon receiving this, the godfather Rolino, with whom I urgently need to speak before departing. Through him may some horses of my gait come to me if they are fat, the blanket of my saddle, and the Catraio, because perhaps I will take him too.\n\nIf there are some shirts send me some, and the straw hat; but let them come as quickly as possible and with a servant whom Bento Gonçalves must send me. Upon the return of godfather Rolino is when I shall write to friends Chastan, godfather Cipriano, Chevalier, to whom you will show this letter so they will consider it theirs, as well as to the friend Chaves, for to all I offer my services for that place. As soon as godfather arrives at Jardim let him send for me, and bring me the pistols.\n\nIt may be that my departure is still revoked, and so do not distress yourself much for now.\n\nGiving a thousand embraces to our children, bless them for me in the name of the Creator: godfather José Félix let this be for him, and your mother a very tight embrace, and farewell that I can no longer [write]. Yours, Almeida.\n\nYesterday I finished closing the lease deal of the establishment about which I spoke to you because of what you said in your letter of the 6th of this month.\n\nLady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
