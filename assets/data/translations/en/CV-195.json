  "translation": "Dear Bernardina of my heart. Pelotas, March 14, 1836.\n\nAfter bitter afflictions, worries, and fears, I received the valuable letters of yours from the 23rd of last month the day before yesterday, and you can judge my satisfaction. Yes, trained by the experience of the brutal and fierce nature of these people, who once followed the party of Braga and today do what Araújo Ribeiro defends, I could not endure my existence when I considered you and our children in the power of this infernal horde; but fortune willed that I was deceived, and that your letters and those of this person informed me otherwise: for, thanks to heaven, you live and our children, for now, without any other discomfort than that attached to the critical circumstances we are going through. I have already told you that I was appointed by the Assembly to which I belong to go to Rio de Janeiro to inform the Government of Brazil about our political state and what we need for the peace of the Province and the integrity of the Empire. This choice could not have been worse, I am the first to recognize it, nor would it be so burdensome for anyone else as for me: however, the good of the Province obliges me, without complaint, to obey an order sacred to me for more than one reason. I know that wife and children, and the unhappy state of our house, should have exempted me from this commission; but the obligation to contribute with all my strength for the good of the Province, and particularly for you and these same children, forced me into an enterprise full of thorns and difficulties: if some unforeseen misfortune does not forever take me away from my family, which I do not expect, the example of serving the Fatherland that I leave for our children is the brightest legacy I can give them: and this single thought consoles me when I consider our separation, etc., etc....\n\nI am ready to leave, and I will do so immediately upon receiving some papers I requested from Bento Gonçalves, which may come to me via Rio Pardo, given the direction this compatriot of ours has taken: however, he does not stop writing me (under cover) to José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim, whom I will entrust to send them to us in case I have already left. As soon as things improve there, or they can come by land, send me the slaves listed in the attached list, to be handed over to the same José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim; and if the godfather Rolino is already at home, let him himself come with this transport, so as to avoid any mishap on the journey. Rio Grande, I think it would be prudent for you and the whole family to come, as I had already decided: but if things take a different turn, I suppose you should stay there until my return from Rio, which I intend to be as soon as possible, even for the reason of the company of your parents, in such a turbulent time as this. In short, on this subject I will still have to write, in view of those you will send me after receiving those I have written you from February 13 until today, etc., etc.... The godfather José Félix and the friend Chastan, who should be consulted and heard in everything, as well as Chaves if possible, etc., etc....\n\nJoão da Cunha informs me of the uprising of the slaves, due to the departure of godfather Rolino and Vicente: he commands to talk to João Grande to manage them, for in truth it is not wise to have them arrogant in such circumstances; and your father should now and then look after this as if it were his own business, in order to prevent mishaps and damage. The master of the yacht should also help in whatever he can, since with the yacht in the port, as it should be, he does not need to go on outings at such a time, and under no circumstances should he fail to sleep on board. The blacks should also not be idle, they should rebuild the fences of the paddocks and farms, hoe them, finish the large lagoon I started at the big paddock, leaving drainage ditches on the sides, so that it does not break with a great water weight, and godfather José Félix or the Senhor should show how to make such drains, both must remain at the same level so that only one does not supply the waters. When this is concluded and if it is still not possible to work in the pottery, they should make a third paddock on the land that runs from the end of what is done to the yard [...].\n\nAs godfather Cipriano has not written to me since he left here, I do not write to him either; give me news of him, of the great Mateus, of Cândido Fernandes Lima, of your cousin José Moreira, of the editor of the Liberal Domingues, of Goularte, and Espíndola of Rio Grande; as well as of everything else that has happened there worthy of remembrance, etc., etc....\n\nThe godfather and godmother, our parents, that they consider this as theirs as well as godfathers José Félix, Joaquim, João, Chaves, Chastan, Chevalier, and David. Embraces to our children, a kiss to Custódia, and you receive the heart of Yours, Almeida.\n\nThose you write to me can be sent to João Gonçalves da Silva, who will forward them to me; and when urgent send by courier, since he does not live very far.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
