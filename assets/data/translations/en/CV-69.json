  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn accordance with the orders and instructions of Your Excellency on the 29th of the previous month, I held the appropriate assemblies of the forces and squadrons under my command at the detachment of Ponta Rasa, and on the 3rd of the current month, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I completed the crossing of all the forces and cavalry to the right bank of the Guaíba River; and on the same day, at 6 o'clock in the afternoon, with the aim of cutting off the enemy's rear, I marched with 370 cavalrymen and 84 said German infantrymen directly engaged to the Erval mountain range, which I crossed in 3 nights, emerging in the clearings called Tavares, where the Justice of the Peace of the rebels, José Gonçalves da Silva, brother of their leader Bento Gonçalves da Silva, was arrested; and after making the necessary inquiries there, I learned that the rebel forces who had crossed to the left bank of the Camaquã River and those who had already gathered had crossed to the right bank of the same river; without delay, I proceeded to the chapel of São João and from there directed, as appropriate, several detachments to various parts, not only to gather horses but to observe and examine the enemy’s ideas, all commanded to join me at the Cordeiro pass, where I was advancing with the main force; and at said pass, a rebel comrade of another rebel officer was arrested; and there on the 9th all detachments joined with one hundred and fifty horses and four more prisoners, one of whom was a certain Lemos, titled lieutenant, and three soldiers arrested by Ensign Fidélis Pais da Silva Feitan.\n\nUpon this junction, in view of what I had gathered, being physically certain that the entire enemy was on the other side of Camaquã and previously forewarned, I took the measures within my reach, notifying on the same day the 9th Lieutenant-Colonel João Frederico, commander of the forces that had come from Rio Pardo, so that he would march with the forces under his command to cross Camaquã directly to the Malaquias estate to establish a watching and observation post on anything discovered. Cristal... at the Santa Isabel pass, facing the chapel of Boqueirão, whose crossing I made on the night of the same day the 9th; and soon I directed several detachments with instructions, to various places, not only to gather horses, arrest rebels and examine enemy movements, all ordered to join me at the Santa Isabel pass, opposite the chapel of Boqueirão, where I was moving to, and where on the 12th we all united; and there more than three hundred horses were counted gathered; and if it had not been for a heavy foggy mist from midnight on the 11th until ten o’clock on the 12th, which prevented surprising and capturing over two hundred more that the rebels had cornered, and the darkness of the night’s mist did not allow their encirclement and the daylight enabled their escape with them.\n\nAt this point of Santa Isabel, combining my thoughts, and seeing that I had already marched more than 40 leagues in pursuit of the enemy, who, well forewarned, had retreated to the center, and with no more horses to gather, and noticing my cavalry considerably strained by the violent marches, and having to make a long withdrawal, I then decided to go with my force to join the forces coming from Rio Pardo, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel João Frederico, at the designated point at the estate of said Malaquias, where, leaving Santa Isabel on the 12th, I arrived on the 13th; and after the junction, on the same day we began our withdrawal, recrossing the Camaquã River at the Armada pass, all forces moving together to the place called the Cordillera, where we separated, that force heading to Rio Pardo and I directly to the Roque hills, inspecting the inhabitants of the districts; and from said Roque Hill I proceeded on the 20th to Ponta Rasa, arriving on the right bank on the 22nd without any loss, with the aforementioned six prisoners and four hundred and fifty horses gathered, who all passed to the Ponta Rasa detachment on the left side of the river; and from there the prisoners were sent to Your Excellency.\n\nMay God guard Your Excellency.\n\nLoyal and Valiant City of Porto Alegre, May 24, 1842.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Count of Rio Pardo\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu\n\nLieutenant-Colonel"
