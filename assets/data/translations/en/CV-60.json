  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nBy virtue of the orders I received from Your Excellency Captain Rafael José Viana on the 21st with 50 men from the 5th Corps and Ensign Prestes, from the 3rd Corps, with 30 men, to gather the horsemen from the vicinity of Cerro do Roque and Erval, in order to maintain the strength of my command which was on foot, which the aforementioned Captain and Ensign Prestes gathered three hundred or so; and I, marching with one hundred and some men from the corps under my command and 50 men from the 3rd Brigade commanded by Captain Antônio Fernando, totaling 230, and making junction at Cerro do Roque, dispatched Major Mariano Martins with one hundred and some men to cross the Serra de São João and scour the coast of Velhaco and Camaquã. I marched with the remainder of the force straight to the parish of Encruzilhada, which I entered on May 26, without encountering any resistance; finding the parish deserted as the inhabitants had fled, terrified by the dreadful reports spread by the farrapos who were going from ridge to ridge, there I made known to the inhabitants the contrary, and handing them the proclamations of Your Excellency Captain Boaventura with 40 men beyond Encruzilhada, and descending along the margin of Camaquã, who joined with me in São José, with 200 horses; I crossed to the other side of Camaquã and sent Lieutenant Isaías with a detachment to the chapel of Boqueirão, and there he gathered the horses he could and descended to the estate of Braga, which is today the wintering place of José Gomes Jardim, the Vice-President of the Republic, to join me; and crossing back the Camaquã Major Mariano, who had gathered 300 tame horses, more than 200 colts, and 40 tame and wild mules. Marching towards São José, I sent Captain Antônio Fernando with the ranks of the 2nd and 3rd Brigades carrying 400 of the best horses and 80 colts upon request from the Most Illustrious Colonel Loureiro, who was heading to the campaign and was lacking horses; and I returned to this place on the 9th of the current month, with 800 tame horses, 200 colts, and 40 tame and wild mules, having found no gathering except small groups in the woods, of whom 3 were killed and saddles and weapons captured.\n\nThe woods are full of men who have deserted from the enemy ranks, saying that only the leadership will gather; the great influentials are very discouraged, and say that from the moment they learned that the farrapos were trapped inside Taquari, they judged the Republic lost, and many are already requesting amnesty from the Government; I, Most Excellent Sir\n\nThis is what I have the honor to bring to the knowledge of Your Excellency Santo Amaro, June 12, 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Manuel Jorge Rodrigues, Lieutenant-General, Commander-in-Chief of the Army in Operations in this Province.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel."
