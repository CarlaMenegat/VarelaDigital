  "translation": "Piratini, November 15, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nBefore receiving your last letter I had already bought to send you the 16 cubits of chintz and pieces of muslin as well, the chintz for you and our daughters and the muslin for the boys’ shirts: I hope you find everything to your liking. Today we had the pleasing news of the arrival, in the vicinity of Porto Alegre, of General Bento Gonçalves; this eases my sorrow, and perhaps later he may still render some services; for he had already requested and obtained resignation even from the position of Colonel. I remain in good health; but, as you can imagine, very distressed for not being able to leave for the neighboring State, because of the situation there.\n\nI do not write more due to the bearer’s haste.\n\nGreetings to the godparents, boys, and everyone at home, and you receive the heart of your faithful Almeida.\n\nBy the first bearer send me all my military arrangements to see if I send them to be sold.\n\nMadam"
