  "translation": "Friend and Sir Almeida Salso, December 18, 1842\n\nIf Your Mercy knows Inácio for uncle Bento in order to give his protection, as I write to Senhor Fontoura, whom I suppose nothing will be done from this side; with him Your Mercy, Bento had given me to pass letters of the rights he had to pay, whose order was now contradicted in the Erval Collectory, I do not know if by the Minister or by the Inspector, and that nothing would be accounted to me without positive order from the government. Therefore, my friend, who is, as I am, with my little fortune sacrificed, and Your Mercy Your Mercy\n\nIt has not been possible to get news of your slaves, and about your yacht in the latest letters I had from Vicente nothing had yet been arranged.\n\nI continue to assure you that whenever I am employed in your service, I will satisfy the one who is\n\nYour constant and faithful friend Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu\n\nPost scriptum I beg you very much for the promptness of this my business, for soon I will need to present the order or pay the rights in money."
