  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nOn the 17th of the current month, at 4 in the afternoon, I left this city with 90 cavalrymen and 60-odd infantrymen, German volunteers, embarked on two barges and two launches; and confronting the islands there, according to orders, the 3rd barge joined me with 40-odd horses and 3 war launches commanded by Navy Lieutenant Rocha; and following all under my command, I made a landing on the 18th, at 4 in the morning, in Santa Cruz; and from there I marched, with 40 horse cavalrymen and the aforementioned infantry commanded by Captain Christe, a league away along the coast of Arroio dos Ratos, where I ordered a false path to be made, and on it I passed the men with much difficulty, in two canoes for which I had the horses' girths taken along in tow.\n\nHaving completed the crossing, I divided the men and ordered several points to be surrounded, the rebel guard being at the mouth of Arroio dos Ratos, at Leão's farm and his charqueada; and with success in all parts, seven rebels were killed, among whom were Legion Colonel José Manuel de Leão and the assassin Antônio Turpim, and 9 were taken prisoner, including Lieutenant Jerônimo and Ensign Inocêncio, one hundred and some horses and one hundred and some cattle, including many tame oxen, some weapons and one hundred and some cartridges packed, one arroba of lead number B and seven bundles of white-handled knives, each bundle containing 25 knives; which cartridges, lead, knives, and 43 leathers with hair, I delivered to the said Lieutenant Rocha.\n\nWith the arrival of Your Excellency Leão, with the 8th Battalion, I followed Your Excellency’s orders to Ponta Rasa, and the other horses to the Detachment island, and one barge of cattle and tame oxen to this capital. All the officers, lower officers and soldiers who accompanied me behaved with great activity, subordination and valor, distinguished especially were Lieutenant Isaías, Ensign Carvalho, and Corporal Fidélis Pais da Silva.\n\nIt is also very praiseworthy the activity of Navy Lieutenant Rocha, and because of him all the other navy personnel who accompanied me. I shall say no more because Your Excellency \n\nYour Excellency  \nPorto Alegre, September 21, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Filipe Neri de Oliveira, Brigadier and Commander of the Brigade.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nDeath of Colonel José Manuel de Leão."
