  "translation": "Friend Senhor Viana\n\nIt is now just 6 o'clock in the afternoon, and it is known that there is an intention to arrest me and all the individuals who were found this morning in that city; some of them have fled and informed me of the little sincerity with which I assured that everything was arranged in the manner we desired. I cannot believe that a confidence was betrayed, which served as a beacon to deliver us from the furies of parties; and therefore I beg you to tell me frankly where to conceal myself, so as never to be held responsible for the consequences that may follow, given the decision in which I see many to whom I exposed what happened in the conference. I am beside myself and wish to be guided today on this matter.\n\nyour house, October 2, 1835. Your sincere friend, Almeida."
