  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that on the 21st at 4 o’clock in the afternoon I embarked 80 men of the corps under my command onto the steamer and 50 horses on the “barge no. 1”, and at about 5 o’clock in the afternoon I proceeded to the charqueadas of Barra, where I disembarked around 11 o’clock at night, immediately taking all necessary measures to prevent news from spreading and to secure some horses in order to mount the rest of the men, which I succeeded in doing; and on the 22nd at 5 o’clock in the afternoon I set out, and on the 23rd at 3 o’clock in the afternoon I besieged the Capela das Dores under a very heavy storm, where Major Domingos Barbosa, commander of the 5th Corps of the rebels, was captured, as well as a sergeant, his brother, and two soldiers; the others escaped on foot since the said chapel is in the middle of the woods, and my soldiers, very wet from the storm, left behind some saddlery and weapons.\n\nAbout 50 gentle horses were recruited and on the 25th I began my retreat to the charqueadas of Barra where I am today and where I proceed to Ponta Rasa, Your Excellency.\n\nI still have parties out and I will inform Your Excellency of any further developments.\n\nCharqueadas da Barra, June 27, 1842.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu"
