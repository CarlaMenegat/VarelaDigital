  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nBeing of absolute necessity, for the good of upholding law and legality, another pulsing ferry for the transport of animals to aid not only the coming and going of the animals of the nation of which I am in charge, which exist, or may also go to the islands adjacent to this city, but also for some necessary attempt to attack the enemy at any point at sea with a force of at least one hundred horsemen; and since the two ferries presently available cannot regularly carry more than fifty horses, a very small number for achieving good success, and this not only to fight the enemy, but also for some surprise cavalry raid which is so necessary for us, as well as in extreme need of meat for the hospitals and people of this city. For these reasons I bring to Your Excellency’s attention\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nHeadquarters in Porto Alegre, October 13, 1838.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Tomás José da Silva — Brigadier and Commander of the Garrison of this capital.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu. Major.\n\nIt is in accordance.  \nJosé Cesário de Abreu. Captain in Charge of the Office."
