  "translation": "My dear Bernardina  \nPorto Alegre, February 17, 1836.\n\nYesterday I sent you a letter in the morning, and after it was sent, the Assembly decided to suspend several guarantees, recommending to the Vice-President, who took office in the afternoon, full authority to expel the anarchists from Rio Grande, from the North and other parts of the Province; as a consequence of which, perhaps within these eight days a large division will have to pass through there, and there will be great agitation among the heroes who provoked these misfortunes upon themselves and the innocent. It is to be supposed that this time the regressive januários will learn their lesson, and therefore one will be able to live with fewer enemies. Considering this, and wishing always to conform to your will, because you deserve it, I will describe the establishment I told you I intended to rent. A house with many rooms, having a stretch of a second floor, containing this poor room, two alcoves, an office and a loft corresponding to the room. Below there are rooms for guests, a coach house, pantry, dining room, and several other small rooms for storage. The kitchen and rooms for slaves are outside; courtyards enclosed on two sides of the house, and on one side a heavily laden leafy olive tree can be seen. The estate follows the bank of the Arroio Petim which, forming a perfect circle, offers a pleasant land: about 300 orange trees bearing fruit, with innumerable other fruit shrubs from Europe and native plants, symmetrically planted, combining utility with pleasure. At the front or on one side of the entrance, there is a famous plantation of pineapples, some banana trees, etc. At one end of the estate there is a house facing the road which serves as a shop, where travelers and neighbors get their necessities, leaving some profit. In the backyard is the laundry, and water is drawn from the river for the pot and other household services. Mango trees, paddocks for calves and horses are immediate. About 400 fathoms away is the well-built pottery, covered with tiles, with clay nearby on the river bank where tiles and bricks are unloaded for the yachts, by means of a large scoop which loads at once from 3 to 4,000 tiles or bricks, since the yachts cannot enter the shallows in summer. From there, 600 fathoms away, is the charqueada (jerky operation) already on the edge of the large cove below the Pedras Brancas: it has a famous brick shed covered with tiles, and with lodgings on one side; the grease house in a small area is immediate, as well as the mango trees and corrals. There is another building on the river’s mouth, which they call customs house, because it is where the goods that have to be shipped are deposited, and where those that come home and to neighbors are received. On the opposite side, facing this house, there is a charqueada, terribly arranged. Three famous paddocks, almost all fenced with thorn, offer all the accommodation for the animals of the charqueada service and the pottery: there they kill with a lasso, but a crane will be useful because there is house brick, rafters and small wood. The firewood for the pottery is abundant; and it is almost inside the same. The port on the side of the Lagoon is not good; because besides the yachts staying away from the shore, needing to be loaded on barges or scoops, they suffer much with Northeast, East and Southeast winds: however, no losses are reported, etc... Jardim, about a quarter of a league, the same Jardim two leagues away and the charqueadas of Barra also about two and a half leagues. The place is pleasant, one can raise a good amount of cattle for cheeses and butter for business and consumption: one can also have a famous flock of sheep.\n\nNow, being so accustomed to your mother, from whom you have never been apart, I fear much that this change to such a remote place will suggest melancholy and spite, very particularly when it is necessary for me to come to the city, which is at a distance of five leagues. But if these considerations on one hand distress me, they also on the other encourage me, reminding me of the labors in which I continually see you in charge of a house transformed into an inn, and my agonies that shall diminish, just because I separate myself a little from the contact of men, always inclined to do me harm, as you better than anyone know.\n\nAdded to all this is having godfather José Félix to instruct our children in the first letters and keep us company, allowing me, during rest, to better develop our interests by not exciting the envy of anyone, and having the city at hand so that later our children may continue higher studies.\n\nHere, my dear Bernardina, is faithfully the picture I make for myself; but, as I said, wishing to march with your will, I beg you to tell me frankly if you feel forced for this change, because everything can be reconciled. It is worth reflecting further that here (I think) I will not be so massacred by my tyrant creditors, either by being out of their thirsty sights, or by being able to resist their cunning traps, and for other reasons that you can perceive. Besides, I will not be employed in anything, and this not challenging the envy and offended self-love of anyone against me, my soul will not be anguished by the shots that have constantly been directed at me for this reason. Added to all these reasons may be the resentment under which our Province has had to struggle for a while, because of the political movements that have taken place. Almost all the people who prepare this reaction must be removed to the Eastern State, under the pretext of Araújo Ribeiro’s possession and destruction of republics; but as soon as order is restored, they reappear as this time, intriguing, agitating and disturbing public order, peace and individual interests. That place is open and accessible from all sides, any assassin can easily enter, perpetrate his crime and escape safely; and in view of such consideration, how can one live peacefully? How to reestablish trust? And how to do business profitably? I suppose more than a year of perfect peace will be indispensable for anything to be done, and that is why in the meantime I wish to employ myself with some small profit outside the clashes with those who know me and where I know them. Cipriano and Felizardo will not rent out that charqueada, and what is appropriate, even if little, for repairing the buildings, bars, mango trees and paddocks, and that product compensates what is given for this other lease. In short, my ideas are confused amid the crowd of considerations that assault me; therefore call friend Chastan; with him, with Chaves whom you will also call, and with our godfather José Félix, arrange what you should do, and put it into execution at once, informing me by land for my governorship; for I will not go in person, because I fear we will miss each other, if indeed by Araújo’s last decision you put into practice what I suggested in the ones I sent you by Antunes and Vicente. The bitterness of those continuing in the expedition is extraordinary; if you can influence someone, do so, even those people who promised to shave the head of the farroupilhas, as it is reported here. My heart beats strongly when I consider the evils that these three towns dared against the Province; may God help me, and enough.\n\nHugs to our children, visits to all our family and friends; your father, godfather José Félix and friend Chastan are well and count on you as their own, and you receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida.  \nPelotas.  \nBy especial grace of the Illustrious Colonel."
