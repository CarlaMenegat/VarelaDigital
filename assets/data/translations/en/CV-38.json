  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that a small rebel force approached the charqueadas of the Costa. In coordination with Major Fernando Kersting, Commander of this Municipality, I sent a detachment to the Costa commanded by Furriel Antônio Rodrigues; and as, due to contrary wind, it could not arrive in time, the rebels moved to the Ilha da Paciência.\n\nDespite my efforts and those of the active Major Commander of the Municipality—both of us marching in pursuit—we could not prevent them from taking some prize horses belonging to Ensign Manuel Antônio of the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard; but it is very likely that, due to the prompt measures taken by the said Major Kersting both by land and sea, the rebels were not only unable to take all the horses from the island, but also two young brothers of the aforementioned ensign, who had been captured by the rebels, were able to escape. The detachment commanded by the aforesaid Furriel Rodrigues captured one rebel and wounded another.\n\nOn this occasion, I deem it my duty to inform Your Excellency that Antônio Francisco de Almeida, who is said to have four sons among the rebels, desires information about the sorties to warn said rebels, many of whom are his relatives. This Almeida, seeing that the intrigues he had fomented in the army against Kersting failed, is now becoming active.\n\nPardon, Your Excellency Sete-Pernas, that for lack of a boat he has been able to commit all kinds of violence against the charqueadores of the coast of the Rio Jacuí.\n\nMay God preserve Your Excellency.\n\nVila do Triunfo, February 15, 1845.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Tomás José da Silva, Marshal and Commander of the Porto Alegre Garrison.\n\nAntônio Pedro de Abreu,\n\nMajor Commander of the Squadron of Triunfo and vicinity."
