  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir,\n\nThe government, sufficiently informed of the essence of the sole office of Your Lordship of the past, has commanded me to respond to Your Lordship Your Lordship.\n\nFortunately, the government recognizes how much Your Lordship Your Lordship 1st Line, authorizes Your Lordship Your Lordship Your Lordship Your Lordship Your Lordship.\n\nA detachment of the bodies of the 1st Line cannot in any way be useful. The soldier outside his corps loses the military habit, forgets discipline, and contracts the vice of insubordination, besides which, when they become demoralized, they are the worst members of society. If the indicated measure does not still please Your Lordship\n\nGod keep Your Lordship. Secretariat of War Affairs in Caçapava, March 9, 1840. Most Illustrious Sir Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães, Chief of Police of the Boqueirão Department. Serafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nOffice of the Most Excellent, March 9, received on the 22nd of the same month, concerning the police, smugglers, etc."
