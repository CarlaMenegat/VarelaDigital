  "translation": "Rio Grande, October 30, 1849.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nI have been persistent in demanding the three hundred thirty-two and a half pesos which, through the intermediation and responsibility of Your Lordship Mr. Manuel Severino Xavier, at the Taquarembó Treasury Office, because, as I have already told Your Lordship Mr. Palácios, when he delivered the commitment document to the same Mr. Xavier last year, he drew the amount on me and I have not been able to satisfy it; this failure leaves, as Your Lordship Mr. Palácios and mine: that of that Mr. Taquarembó to be delivered here counting that the payment would already have been made, and mine, because it is the cause of that unpleasant failure.\n\nIf it were not for this circumstance I would not have spoken for a long time about this matter; I would wait for the true debtor to place in the hands of Your Lordship Mr. Palácios, to whom the person who was supposed to receive the money here has made charges, I am unable to refrain from informing you of the reason for not having satisfied your order, especially since the same Mr. Vasco Madruga assured Mr. Palácios that he had delivered the three hundred thirty-two and a half pesos to the charqueador to whom Manuel Severino Xavier sold the cattle.\n\nLeaving with this explanation the reply to your esteemed letter of the 19th of this month satisfied, I remain\n\nAt the disposal of Your Excellency, Atanásio C. Aguirre\n\nReceived on November 4, 1849.\n\nRio Grande, October 30, 1849. From Mr. Atanásio Aguirre.\n\nReceived on November 4, 1849. Replied on November 22, 1849."
