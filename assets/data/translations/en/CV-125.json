  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nIt was presented to Your Excellency on the 16th of the current month, and, being informed of what Your Excellency in Santa Maria has done regarding the measures that in such a case should be put into action and that were at the disposal of the government; nevertheless, it is recommended to Your Excellency the Most Illustrious Bento Manuel and to Lieutenant Colonel Portinho, who by this hour will be in motion with the body under his command, but as is to be presumed, he will come by São Francisco or São Xavier, and may end up isolated.\n\nIn any case, see to it, Your Excellency, Fontoura and the Justice of the Peace Porto assure me that the enemy force consists of about one hundred men; therefore, the government expects that Your Excellency of São Paulo, with the force that Your Excellency has.\n\nThe attached copy will inform Your Excellency in Santa Maria, and since the enemy appears this side of São Gonçalo, perhaps there may be some arrangement, and in this hypothesis it is necessary that everything be undertaken to thwart their intended junction. The 2nd Corps of Lancers may perhaps be available, and may reinforce the force of Your Excellency Agostinho who should ascend with some men via the Picada do Botucaraí, and Major Fontoura informed me that he was proceeding to Santa Maria and it would be very convenient that they act in accord and agreement. If in this municipality the meetings that were begun take place, it may be possible to detach some force for that part, etc. The Quartermaster Teodoro José de Medeiros, bearer of this, will be partly satisfied with what he requires, not being able to fulfill all because the War Train is exhausted of many principal supplies.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nSecretary of War Affairs in Caçapava, December 18, 1839.  \nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nAnswered on the 21st of the current month."
