  "translation": "My late Bernardina Bordo, October 16, 1835.\n\nIn possession of your esteemed letter of yesterday, I thank heaven for having given you strength to endure the blow that fate has dealt us; and once again I urge you to utmost submission and steadfastness in the labors of this world, for in no other way can we overcome the obstacles that surround us. I truly feel the direction that public opinion has taken regarding me, judging me as a criminal and attributing to me all that hot-headed and malicious ideas have suggested to them; but all this is nothing compared to your afflictions, which are above all what weighs me down. And if you therefore esteem me and wish to see me content, even in the face of death, make it so that I know you live peacefully and attend to the education of our children. Consider that others have been in a condition even more desperate than ours, and by constant resignation to the decrees of providence they overcame difficulties that seemed insurmountable, and were afterward restored to the position they had lost. I complain of no one, nor do I intend the smallest revenge, and only wish to withdraw with horror from everything that links me to men. Only thus shall I live content in the midst of my dear family.\n\nI have also been informed of the conduct of our creditors and I am not surprised: they do what was to be expected. And if it were not for the season and the ends that I discern in this, I would gladly hand over everything to them, since living as I have lived, any means of subsistence would be much more favorable to me, sparing you the sorrow in which you live, etc.; but for them to seek to take advantage of my absence to do with my house the same as they did with that of João José Gomes is what I cannot endure, and I order that they oppose such a vile and harmful handling.\n\nHowever, if they do carry forward a very premeditated plan, do not give in to despair, for God abandons no one. I already knew this stratagem, which they sweetened to me with leaving you 10% and even promoting a subscription; but from the outset I distrusted so much fortune, so much generosity, with the one who… etc… Finally, regarding this I write to our friend Chaves and cousin Cipriano, and I trust that they will do what they can for our benefit. I still persist in the project.\n\nIn another letter I will be more extensive. Embraces to our children and regards to all our kin, receiving from your husband Almeida the heart of your heart.\n\npost scriptum Send me tomorrow the following: Political Economy Social Contract Beccaria or “Treatise on Crimes and Punishments” Works of Telinho Elípio Black silk stockings 1 barrel of tongues 1 portion of meat 1 syringe throat And João to separate and keep all Barros’s accounts, the opinion of the Commission on the concordat, and all documents and papers not pertaining to the household’s affairs. The friend Chaves and cousin Cipriano are to send me letters of recommendation for Rio; and cousin Cipriano to send me some money, if he can, in Rio.\n\nLady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
