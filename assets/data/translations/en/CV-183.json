  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart Porto Alegre, December 15, 1835.\n\nI have already received two of yours, and from the joy both have produced in me, you can judge by the sensations you feel when you receive mine. I had been quite distressed until a few days ago thinking that well-directed intrigues had produced distrust between ours; however, seeing on the contrary that firm progress is being made for the good of our Province, pleasure has reborn in my heart. I now live content, and the young ladies do not leave me troubled; poor things, they waste their time, because I do not care for them and, consequently, all say that there is no girl more fortunate than you, that I am the example of the married, and with this I make the marital state desirable. And how about that? See how much my behavior is worth and how happy you are having a young, handsome, well-made, and faithful husband. Where else is so much found together? Indeed, in this century it is a phenomenon, a marvel, etc., etc.\n\nHugs to our children, regards to all our people, and goodbye until the 23rd of this month, God willing; save me something. Your husband of the heart Almeida.\n\nMadam Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
