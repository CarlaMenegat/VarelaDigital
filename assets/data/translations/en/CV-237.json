  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, March 30, 1838.\n\nHaving only written what is seen above, to dispatch the Lord to there, I receive yours of the 28th of this month and another from the godfather with the same date: I am therefore pleased with the health condition of our children, yet tears came to my eyes upon the position of your brother.\n\nGod wills it so; it is our duty to respect His decrees. Last night, without expecting it, the appointment to again occupy the position I had left came to my hands: judge for yourself how much this incident must have disturbed me! I have already pledged my friendship and services to the President and the Republic to be excused from such an employment; nothing has been granted; however, I shall still remain firm until you tell me what I should do about it: for despite seeing my adversaries falter, and the slanders they hurled at me disproved, still my repugnance is invincible.\n\nBy the mulatto, I will send you all that you request, as well as what your father asks, whom you will comfort to receive with resignation the blow that heaven prepares for him.\n\nI would esteem that our children are not in danger, especially Bruto, whose loss would throw me into despair: embraces to all, regards to your father, mother, and brothers, and receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nMadam. Feliz Retiro."
