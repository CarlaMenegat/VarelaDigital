  "translation": "My beloved wife  \nPorto Alegre, December 12, 1835.\n\nBy yesterday's mail I did not receive a letter from you, which has greatly distressed me, especially because I dreamed of seeing you weeping. Our troubles, instead of lessening, are increasing, and you can imagine how much this troubles me, having been away for twelve days.\n\nIf my duties call me to your arms, the Fatherland commands that I do not leave it: God help me!!! The camarilla, with the denial of possession to Araújo Ribeiro, has been discouraged at once, and for that reason they invent absurdities; but you must not have the slightest fear, for everything is heading towards a single end, and the Fatherland will be saved.\n\nLonging to all our loved ones and embraces to the halves of our souls. On the holy days you will have from your husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida  \nPelotas."
