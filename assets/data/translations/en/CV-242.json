  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, May 23, 1838.\n\nWith the shipment of the horses to Mr. Captain Zeferino, just now, three in the afternoon, I can send off José. Through him I send one arroba of herbs, and in the first cart that is available for that I will send more.\n\nAlso going is the medicine for Epaminondas, to whom you should apply continuous baths of mallow, milk, and water, and you should avoid all heavy food and drink, as well as making him cry so as not to provoke bleeding. As for Aristides, the same already recommended should be done, which will not be anything serious as I hope in God. No medicines are going for Mariana’s son since you did not say what symptoms the illness has; finally, only a cartload of patience can serve us.\n\nThe planned invasion on this point has dissolved, thanks to providence; however, I remain vigilant, and do not have the slightest worry about me. The troops from Rio Pardo have not yet arrived; neither has the President, and I am desperate to be free from the annoyances of spirit that have greatly troubled me, so much that anxiously I wish to see myself in any corner of the Eastern State, although that is also risky, for I am already without patience.\n\nAlways send me word of how the boys are doing, whom you will embrace for me. Regards to your parents, Chiquinha, José Rodrigues, his wife, godfather Joaquim and his wife; and you receive the heart of Your Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Bom Retiro, at the farm of Mr. José Rodrigues Chaves."
