  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nBefore Your Excellency Antônio José de Abreu, confident that a just and impartial judgment will be rendered, in view of the arbitrary decision handed down against the appellant by the current Judge of Law of the District of Piratini, as is now demonstrated.\n\nHaving died intestate the foreigner José Augusto Ledek, that judge proceeded to collecting the assets, depositing them in the custody of a depositary in ... of September of the current year, document no. 1, failing to appoint a Curator of the estate in suspense, which he only did after some days, assigning this appointment to the appellant, who took the oath as is evidenced by the said document.\n\nIn this state of affairs, recognizing that it is the appellant’s duty, by virtue of the laws in force, to administer the assets of the inheritance, he requested from that judge the delivery and administration thereof, since by that term which he had signed he became responsible for any fraud or omission on his part (document no. 2).\n\nAnd when the appellant expected that this would be granted to him as it was in accordance with the law, that judge, disregarding the law, by his oral order made the respective records go forward to his decision; and before granting the appellant’s request, he issued in said records the ruling found in document no. 1, by which he excluded the appellant from the office of Curator, a ruling that harmed his reputation, because the frivolous pretext he alleged cannot save him, since he was well aware that the deposit had been made, and the depositary named by him, long before the appellant was appointed Curator.\n\nIt is therefore in view of the considered reasons that the appellant believes that the said judge has manifestly wronged him, and having no other recourse but to appeal to the authority of Your Excellency.\n\nYours faithfully in Piratini, 2 October 1841. Antônio José de Abreu"
