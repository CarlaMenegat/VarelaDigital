  "translation": "My dear Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida of the heart Porto Alegre, January 12, 1836.\n\nDeeply troubled by the thought of your afflictions, I still write to you despite having written yesterday. The cloud currently darkening the horizon of our Province is indeed quite black; but I do not despair of its salvation, if the consummate prudence presiding over the acts of administration promptly dispels the fears that the enthusiasm of a false patriotism, along with ignoble revenges, has caused to reawaken. The response of the appointed President to the Chamber of the town of the North has provoked bitter dissatisfactions, by stoking provincialism, thus exciting passions that might greatly compromise the course of affairs.\n\nI no longer go out to avoid disputes in defense of those expressions, although I understand them; but that does not prevent me from bearing in hurt silence the part that concerns me, particularly when I think that this Chamber, to which such a brilliant speech was addressed, is faced here by only two individuals originating from there. Nevertheless, despite the just bitterness that accompanies me, I am resolved to close my eyes to everything and redouble my efforts so that the Province may be snatched from the abyss that threatens it: in it I have you and seven children, and that suffices for me to wish it all happiness, etc., etc. I therefore earnestly beg you to disregard everything that may be said to you about me which could disturb your peace; even avoid, my dear beloved Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida, the persons who with such news will come to afflict you there. Consider that we are in a crisis, and that until it unfolds to give its outcome, it will be wrong to take as true in bulk whatever is invented, etc., etc.\n\nFarewell, embraces to all our people and receive the heart of your sincere Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
