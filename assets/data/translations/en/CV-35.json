  "translation": "My most esteemed godfather and friend  \nPiratini, September 5, 1842.\n\nBefore receiving your most esteemed letter of the 18th of last month, I had written to you sending the bill that was in the possession of ... however, it accompanies this one to Captain Miguel, to whom I am going to give news of myself and my family; I am getting by as always, as you already know, with my ailments, your godmother also does not enjoy much health, which is not the case at all with your goddaughter who is very fat and lively and without having bladder issues despite no precautions.\n\nI would very much appreciate having the pleasure of seeing you here for the festival and my esteemed godmother; I do not offer you my house because I had notice from the owner to vacate and that Senhor Joaquim Pedro Soares would come to it, because he is the commander of the Left Division and therefore can do everything, and the other thing is that I have to go to the middle of the street because there are no rental houses; in short, this time I will have to go live in Pelotas; there are many there, even for free; the delay is while the bearer arrives from Alegrete whom Joaquim Pedro sent to the government since they said that having been rented by the State it is with him that Dutra should understand.\n\nI, the only hope I have is to have offered my arrears for a year of rent; if that is already arranged, as I hope, it will be good, otherwise I will resort to everything.\n\nI inform you that you had one hundred and ninety-something votes at the popular table of this city for Deputy and I am convinced that, despite your enemies working against you, they will not succeed; I say this about the Alegrete slate in which neither you nor godfather José Mariano appear.\n\nRegarding news from Rio for sure nothing is known because some paper that appears besides those of the government that come from São Paulo state everything finished, Feijó arrested and sent to Rio, Tobias fled, etc.\n\nYour godmother warmly recommends herself to Your Excellency  \nYour godfather and sincere friend  \nAntônio José de Abreu\n\nNota Bene  \nAlegrete; he complains to me of not receiving letters from you because he says he is your friend, even if useless, and that he does not know if he received the papers he sent you.\n\nTo citizen Domingos José de Almeida.  \nBagé.\n\nAccompanies a letter for Santa Isabel."
