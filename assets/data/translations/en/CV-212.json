  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir,\n\nRecognizing the government that, for the prompt consolidation of the republican system, which the vast majority of the inhabitants of this State have solemnly proclaimed and to which they have sworn to defend, it is absolutely necessary to contract a loan, which, ensuring advantageous profit to the competitors, meets the necessities of the war without burdening the already overburdened peoples, and even to avoid violent measures, although applicable in the current state of affairs, I have been tasked with promoting the said loan, as seen in the attached decree of May 29 last.\n\nFor the same reason, I address Your Excellency requesting 1,000,000 reis in silver or gold, which will be paid within the term set by the mentioned decree with a premium of one and a half percent per month, which shall begin to accrue from the day this Department receives the duly executed document.\n\nTo the Treasury on this date, indeed in this city, Your Excellency will send \n\nPiratini, June 9, 1837.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida.\n\nPresidency of the Republic Secretariat\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Inácio de Oliveira Guimarães\n\nPelotas\n\nFrom the Minister of State of the Treasury Affairs."
