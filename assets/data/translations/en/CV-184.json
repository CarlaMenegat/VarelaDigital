  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart  \nPorto Alegre, December 20, 1835.\n\nThe eagerness with which ill-intentioned people constantly seek to bring you distress is the most singular thing one can witness. Disregard the intrigues of these wicked ones, and remember that great works are made for great hearts. Is it to be wondered that cousin Cipriano, Felizardo, José Pedro, and Bernardino have there tolerated, and perhaps even helped, to spread the rumor of Republics? Indeed, no one can boast of not being deceived. And now, with what face will they stand? At any rate, let us move on to other matters. On Wednesday, the 23rd, I depart for there, and there I will take care of what I know about myself here.\n\nHugs to our children, to your parents, to godfather José Félix, and to all at home.  \nYour husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nI will write something more to Antunes; let the godfather ask him for the letter."
