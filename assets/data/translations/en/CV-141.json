  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nThe office of Your Lordship was presented to the government, including the copy of the report by Captain Fileno; and, having been informed of its contents, there is nothing to add in response, except to reiterate the orders issued on the 17th and 18th of the current month. No communication has been received regarding the force that appeared in Taquari, from which it may be suspected either that it is stationed there or that it has retreated, which would not be possible considering the march of the force headed to Bagé.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nSecretariat of War Affairs in Caçapava, March 19, 1840.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
