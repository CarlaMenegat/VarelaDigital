  "translation": "Today at 5 o'clock in the early morning, our enemies came into the chapel of Santa Maria, having come from Cima da Serra, and wanting to ascertain their strength I sent Lieutenant José Jacinto with 5 men, and in the first shots he was killed, and after observing their strength I withdrew with 10 men, which was all the men I had; on this same date I have already reported to the Illustrious Sir João Antônio, informing him of what occurred; the force I was able to observe was about one hundred and some men; I remain at this location keeping watch over the enemy's movements.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Pereira — Captain of the National Guards Vacacaí, December 15, 1839, at 8 o'clock in the day.\n\nIt is correct. The captain employed in the War Secretariat. (a) Vicente Ferrer de Almeida.\n\nAnnexed to document CV-123."
