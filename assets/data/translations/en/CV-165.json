  "translation": "In view of the enclosed documents, which cost us quite a lot to seize, you will see what is happening here; it is useless to be extensive in expressing to you the contentment and joy of all these people when they received the letters from General Bento Manuel: there were celebrations at 15 or 16 houses, rockets, etc.; today a big dinner at B.R.B.'s house in thanksgiving, and for the good arrival of Major Melo: finally, little by little, everyone is coming together to perhaps arrange new plans; what is certain is that You, Colonel Bento Gonçalves are of the same mold, that the latter is chief of S...., etc. and other pleasant epithets. The Chamber met extraordinarily yesterday to open said letters, but for now they have not made them public.\n\nAfter all, You Lords are all (in the opinion of these people) those who instigate the proclamation of the Republic: but they want it so because they have nothing to lose, and other endless invectives. Your friend Doctor João had the imprudence to say, in the presence of several people, and even of You, that he hoped to see that when some returned to their homes, they would find their goods in the public square. In short, they speak with such vigor that it is astonishing. All this is quite tedious, but may it serve as government. Believe that there remain few sincere friends for you here.\n\nI ask you not to return here unless you see full security to do so.\n\nAccording to what they say, Crescêncio and Neto are firm.\n\nBernardina"
