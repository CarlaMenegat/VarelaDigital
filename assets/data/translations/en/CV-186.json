  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart  \nPorto Alegre, January 5, 1836.\n\nFrom Pedras Brancas I wrote to you informing you of my journey up to there, and now I do so for the pleasure that always accompanies me whenever I engage with you, even if only in writing. Yesterday the Provincial Assembly resolved to inaugurate President Araújo Ribeiro, in which, as much as I could, I concurred, and for that I challenged some indisposition against myself; but it does not matter, because I prefer the good of the Province to that ephemeral popularity in times like these we are going through, and so the reactionaries were convinced that their deceptions were worth nothing this time. I will remain until the President's inauguration, not only so that it is not thought that I withdraw for that reason, but also because I am resolved to follow from here to Santa Ana to see if I can promote the collection of what is owed to me at that point and São Gabriel. To this end, I order João da Cunha to give me the accounts I request and to send them to Bagé to my godfather Rafael, so that I find them when I pass by there. The city remains calm and everything promises tranquility, despite the dust that has been raised everywhere against republics that exist in the minds of people of good order, but which do not produce the effect they desired.\n\nRecommendations to all our people and tender embraces to our children, receiving you the affectionate heart of  \nYour husband from the heart  \nAlmeida.\n\nPost scriptum: Mr. Chastan, and may he not neglect the collection from Granja.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
