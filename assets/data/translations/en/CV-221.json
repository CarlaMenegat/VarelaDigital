  "translation": "Piratini, August 9, 1837. Senhor Antônio José Gonçalves Chaves.\n\nThe day before yesterday I received two of your letters dated the 9th of last month, and having to respond to them, I will begin with the first. I sent 1,500 pesos for the purchase of an item that was necessary for the State as well as 600$ to Renovato: and although I found no basis for my brother-in-law's order, it was good; because I only owe Renovato four hundred and sixty thousand réis, which Your Mercy\n\nThe Senhor Pelotas; I have already written to him about the paper money and he replied that he had sent it to Your Mercy.\n\nPerhaps we shall see each other very soon there; and at this date I send my orders to have the slaves sent if they have been well treated at 16 pesos each, both in winter and summer. I will now proceed to your 2nd letter. The slaves, as I told you, belong to my brother-in-law João Rodrigues Barcelos; I made this clear to Victorica, informing him that if he did not approve or send for them, he should return the money I asked for in advance, which fortunately my wife had not yet received: therefore I am sending them to Your Mercy.\n\nAs for the jaguars I requested, it suffices that you only send me twenty, since I have been able to draw, etc., etc. I will write immediately to my father-in-law about what Your Mercy\n\nI repeat that you will have me there soon, and then we shall talk at leisure. I wish you all prosperity for being truly your faithful and old friend.\n\n(a) Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nNB — Whatever Bernardina asks for must be sent, as she will take care of clothing the blacks as soon as they arrive there.\n\n(a) Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Senhor Antônio José Gonçalves Chaves, Montevideo."
