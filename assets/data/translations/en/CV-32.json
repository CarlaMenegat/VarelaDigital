  "translation": "My most esteemed godfather and sir Piratini, October 24, 1841.\n\nYesterday I took possession of your esteemed letter of the 16th of the current month accompanying the power of attorney for my friend Mateus and his lady, as well as the official letter for Freitas to deliver to me one hundred thousand réis from the proceeds of the auction of the goods of the late Ledek, for which I thank you very much, but unfortunately it has no effect as I was informed that the net amount was delivered here to Shemit and that he ordered Fayete to have it collected at the Treasury, the bearer being the son of Major Pires who left here for that place on the 21st; well, patience. All resources by Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency Guilherme Schnepf; I think all justice is done; Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency\n\nThe health of Your Excellency Your Excellency Godfather friend, thank you very much Antônio José de Abreu\n\nReturns the official letter from Freitas. Answered on November 5, 1841."
