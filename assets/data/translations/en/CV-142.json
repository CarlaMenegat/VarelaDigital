  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nThe two official letters from Your Excellency dated the 15th of this month remain in my possession after having been presented to the government, and to which I am able to respond that Lieutenant José Antônio de Faria will proceed with what has been done regarding Your Excellency's requisition in Cachoeira, and as he will have a delay of one or two more days, I hope that Your Excellency in Trem, and for this reason, Your Excellency in Rio Pardo will not bring from there any portion of cloth, which, going to the army, could not advance, which will be applied to the force under your command.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.\n\nSecretariat of War Affairs in Caçapava, March 19, 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira.\n\nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
