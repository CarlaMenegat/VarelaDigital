  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn compliance with the orders of Your Excellency, I commanded the Provisional 29th of the 5th Cavalry Company of the Squadron of the Barra, embarked on the yacht “Ventura Feliz” of Captain João Antônio, accompanied by the war schooner under the command of Lieutenant José Ricardo to the coast of the Lagoa dos Patos, at the place called Tapes, where I arrived on the 6th, at dawn; and following my details, I soon arrested a guard police of anarchists, in which arrest two perished resisting, both being among the most vicious. I immediately seized the yacht São Manuel, belonging to the rebel João Antônio Lopes, loaded with yerba mate, ready to set sail, which for the third time was there with a large supply for the anarchists, as well as other cargoes still held on land for loading onto another yacht, in addition to more dried yerba mate and hides. Furthermore, on the same day, I ventured out with horses and at night I proceeded with 30 men to the Capela das Dores to arrest certain highly trusted anarchists; however, being warned when the horses were caught by a certain Chico Rocha, who like lightning was able to warn and send warning everywhere to his ragged colleagues, so that when at midnight I surrounded their houses they were all already in the woods, leaving me only with the families.\n\nNevertheless, centrally about three and a half leagues away, at the site of Miguel Barbosa, I took a bronze piece with its fittings, which had been taken from the barge of the new Legality at Rio Pardo on the 30th of April of this current year, which was en route to the Rio Camaquã, where it is said a squadron of rebels is being prepared. After escorting and embarking this piece, and everything else I seized, fearing a sudden ambush, I ordered some troops to embark, and with almost two-thirds already embarked and having already released the horses, I was unexpectedly attacked by a force of more than 50 enemy men, and even on foot, with this small number, I confronted them, in such a position that the anarchists, after giving the first discharge under their fury and receiving another from the loyalists plus some shots from the rear where they did not expect it, turned on one another; and on this occasion, four shots of round shot from the cannon of the gunboat were well delivered to them, which contributed to the rebels leaving the field; some wounded were clearly identified, and the said informer Chico Rocha escaped on foot among the rags, leaving his horse shot and dead with the tack; and among the loyalists, thanks to divine providence, no one was injured. After this, I embarked with the rest of the men on the same day, the 7th of this month, immediately setting the vessels to sail to this capital where they are anchored, spending nearly eight days on the return due to lack of wind. Seized from the said rebel João Antônio Lopes were the yacht São Manuel, two black men who were on the yacht, 1,500 arrobas of dried yerba mate, Your Excellency.\n\nBarracks in Porto Alegre, July 16, 1838.\n\nMost Excellent Sir Francisco Xavier da Cunha, Brigadier Commander of the Garrison of this capital.\n\nPorto Alegre  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nCaptain"
