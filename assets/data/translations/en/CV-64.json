  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nI inform Your Excellency that Ibicuí, with 80 cavalrymen, according to Your Excellency's orders, proceeded to Santa Maria, where a captain, 8 rebel soldiers, 16 horses and colts were surprised, and I sent to this place 5 wagons carrying salt, wheat flour, sugar, and fabrics; I bought for the nation 180 arrobas of yerba mate and 100 alqueires of manioc flour, and all remained today on this side.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Melo, upon your request for his assistance, promptly marched with his battalion making forced marches halfway, to protect my retreat and the crossing of the pass with all the goods. David Canabarro and Guedes and Demétrio marched towards Alegrete, from there to pursue Colonel Loureiro; Bento Gonçalves is at Batovi, with the infantry; it is said he is going to Bagé; Portinho is said to have stopped at Cruz Alta; I believe he intends to withdraw to Botucaraí, and Joaquim Pedro, going to Encruzilhada with 100 men, headed towards Cachoeira.\n\nMay God preserve Your Excellency. Rincão do Inhamandá, July 14, 1841. Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto. Brigadier and Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Francisco Pedro de Abreu. Lieutenant Colonel."
