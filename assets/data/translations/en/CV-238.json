  "translation": "Secretary of State for Treasury Affairs, Piratini, April 5, 1838.\n\nHaving to be put into effective progress as provided by the decrees of November 11, 1836, and April 5, 1837, not only to collect the goods abandoned by the enemy, which through an inconceivable apathy or criminal indolence have been left to the destructive hands of time and immoral men, who, in the excesses of misunderstood patriotism, destroy capitals that immense labors and commendable economies have accumulated; but also to secure to the State the proceeds of these goods, or to the innocent children of the country, who by the deeds of their parents should not be deprived of the solicitations of a nation that recognizes the principles of justice and bases its conduct upon them, and likewise so that such proceeds properly applied may serve to lessen the hardships of the citizens who are armed, and of their families, the government determines that Your Excellency\n\n- 1st, identify the owners, whether they sided with the enemy and made war upon us, or if when it broke out in January 1836 they were already in occupied territory and without means of escape;\n- 2nd, if they are married and have children, and if these exist in the management of the houses or in the Army;\n- 3rd, what portion of land, roughly more or less, forms each property, what buildings or factories exist on them, and approximately how many cattle, horses, and sheep; how many slaves, their sexes, ages, and occupations;\n- 4th, finally, the estimated value of said properties, their furniture, and utensils.\n\nSimilar reports are required from the nationals themselves. The government entrusts to their patriotism the prompt advancement of this order, immediately removing any obstacle that stands against it, and may, to carry out so important a service, call to its aid persons of probity and aptitude that it deems necessary, without however depleting army ranks.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency,\n\nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nLetter of Domingos José de Almeida, April 5, received on May 1. (Handwriting by Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães)"
