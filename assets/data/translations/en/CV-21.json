  "translation": "Citizen Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu states that the State owes him the value of the cattle listed in the attached document, and that, due to the present war in which the nation is involved, his means of subsistence and those of his numerous family have been completely ruined. He therefore requests that Your Excellency order payment of the amount in tax deductions for livestock he dispatches from his property at any State Tax Office, and wishing to be as little burdensome as possible to the Rio Grande do Sul State, the Petitioner offers to the government, free of charge, from this same debt, the amount equivalent to six hundred head of cattle for breeding.\n\nHe requests from Your Excellency,\n\nAntônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu  \nBagé, January 22, 1842.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Treasury, Bagé, [torn] January 1842.  \nFiscal Prosecutor Silva.\n\nTo the Accounting Department. Read. Verified is the attached document in the amount of 5:326$500 rs.:  \n197 steers — 4$500 = 886$500  \n247 cows — 3$200 = 796$800  \n3036 breeding cattle — 1$200 = 3:643$200  \nGeneral Treasury Accounting Office in Bagé, January 25, 1842.  \nInterim Accountant Viana\n\nHaving to cease the system of transactions through the Tax Offices, whose results weigh so terribly today on the Treasury; the government finding itself more compelled to immediately pay long outstanding debts for supplies consumed by the army, as well as the urgent need to continue purchasing these same supplies; it is not possible to promptly comply with the Petitioner, since the payment demanded in tax deductions on the goods he intends to dispatch is not as slow as he imagines, as can be verified in many ways, as has happened; and since the sum demanded by the Petitioner is considerable, this would only add a new burden to the many that currently hinder our financial state; however, wishing the government to reconcile as much as possible private interest with public demands, the Petitioner will be attended to in due course, granting him in deduction a portion of these dispatches he deems to make, which will be verified at the Treasury and no longer at any Tax Office.  \nSecretary of the Treasury, Bagé, January 26, 1842.  \nFontoura."
