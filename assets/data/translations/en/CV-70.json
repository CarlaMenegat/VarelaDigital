  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nIn accordance with the orders and instructions of Your Excellency of April 29, on the third day of the current month I crossed to the right bank of the Jacuí, and that same afternoon, with 370 cavalrymen and 84 infantry of the Company of German Engaged, also mounted, I proceeded to the Serra do Erval with the purpose of cutting off the enemy’s retreat who was found with part of his forces on this side of the Camaquã. After three nights of the most cautious march, I reached the farms called Tavares where I captured José Gonçalves da Silva, brother of Bento Gonçalves, titled chief of the republic, who in that faction performed the role of Justice of the Peace. There I learned that the rebel forces had already crossed to the right bank of the Camaquã. I proceeded without delay to the Chapel of São João Lemos, all prisoners taken by Ensign Fidélis Pais da Silva, of the 5th Cavalry Corps. In view of the precipitate flight of the anarchists, I sent word to Lieutenant Colonel João Frederico Caldwell that with the forces of his command he should cross the Camaquã, marching in the direction of the Malaquias ranch, where he should support my movements, while I crossed the same river at the Mendonça ford.\n\nOn the same day, the 9th, everything was carried out with the greatest caution and speed, proceeding to the chapel of Boqueirão, where I joined the detachment that I had sent to various places, and were it not for a great fog that lasted until 10 o’clock in the morning, I would have surprised more than 200 rebel men, taking nevertheless more than 300 fine horses from them. Seeing that the enemy gained great advantage in his retreat, and that I had advanced more than 40 leagues with violent marches, having to make a long retreat without finding more horses to gather, I resolved to join forces with Lieutenant Colonel Caldwell on the 13th, and marching together until the place called Cordilheira, there we separated, that lieutenant colonel moving towards Rio Pardo, and I towards Cerro do Roque, arriving at the bank of the Jacuí at Ponta Rasa on the 22nd, without any other news.\n\nFrom that place I immediately sent the 6 prisoners to this capital; putting the horses in good custody, I immediately sent the forces by Your Excellency to Jacuí. In this manner I report to Your Excellency\n\nMay God guard Your Excellency, Loyal and Valiant City of Porto Alegre, May 24, 1842. Most Illustrious and Excellent Count of Rio Pardo\n\nDraft"
