  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nYesterday afternoon I sent Lieutenant Gomes to the other side of Vacacaí to gather news of the enemy, from where he was able to learn orally, from a comrade of Captain Alexandre, who sent me word that almost at dusk some squadrons were ascending the Coxilha do Durasnal near Santa Maria and that they would be about 100 men, having in the afternoon seen the fields around the same chapel set on fire without knowing who did it. The firefighters of Captain Alexandre say that, besides this force, they learned of the existence of another one, but they could not discover it because it was already late; I again send out Lieutenant Gomes to Vacacaí with 4 good and well-mounted men, to see if they pass at the pass, and then I shall make my retreat, trying to join Major Fontoura, according to the order I had from him, nineteen ill-armed men, including some very old and boys of 14 years, among whom are 2 sons of the deceased Captain Lino de Brum, whom their mother sent to us. I will maintain all activity on my part, however I always remind Your Excellency Vacacaí, my reports will be more delayed, because you will then have to move through Santa Bárbara below on the troops' road, unless they also cut me off. I remind Your Excellency Vacacaí in the direction of that point, of the four men you have do Jacuí to notify, which perhaps will be a vocal warning.\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency  \nField at Fazenda do Meio, December 18, 1839  \nVicente de Paula Simões Pires\n\nIt is as stated.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nCopy attached to document CV-125"
