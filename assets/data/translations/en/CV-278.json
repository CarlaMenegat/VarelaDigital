  "translation": "My distinguished colonel and respectable friend  \nPiratini, January 9, 1839.\n\nNot wishing to take an arbitrary decision regarding the primary school teacher of São Gabriel without consulting Your Excellency, Your Excellency\n\nYour secretary must necessarily be missed by you, but the position for which he was entrusted is vacant, for it is not in accordance with justice to provide it while the owner is employed there. I believe he will not lack patriotism and that, if he wishes to keep his position, he must himself place another in his stead, or resign it in order to later be employed in something better.\n\nTell me, Your Excellency,\n\nYour sincere and very grateful friend,  \nDomingos José de Almeida  \nPiratini, January 9, 1839."
