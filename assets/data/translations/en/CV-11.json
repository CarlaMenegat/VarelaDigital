  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nThe citizen Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu, upon leaving this capital, informing me that Your Excellency Erval and Boqueirão, for the importance of them being found in what the State owes him, and for what he agreed with Your Excellency Alexandre Silveira Lopes to have the same fate, asked me to accept the said documents from him, which I did.\n\nThe letter, copy, and official letters numbered 1, 2, and 3 verify what I have expressed; and therefore, being overwhelmed by the requirement of a power of attorney for the registration of the settled debt of the said citizen, registration which I requested as the transfer of the seat of government approaches, and the account in question must appear in the Treasury for the transactions to be made should the promised meeting be verified, once again I request Your Excellency\n\nDomingos José de Almeida Bagé, March 19, 1842\n\nAttached to document CV-10."
