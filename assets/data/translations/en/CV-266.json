  "translation": "Friend Sir\n\nThe 158$880 can either be debited by us, or received from the State on behalf of those who requested it, and they are considered included in the latest loan, to be paid from the first available funds: therefore it is at your discretion what you wish. As for Paulo Vicente's account, I do not know who he is, but if you tell me, I can then respond regarding what is required in that respect. Dispose of\n\nYour sincere very grateful friend Almeida Piratini, November 10, 1838.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Carlos Fernandez de Quincoze. Your House."
