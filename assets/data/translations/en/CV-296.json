  "translation": "My Excellency\n\nThe good and compassionate heart of Your Excellency João Bonifácio and others after the abdication; and if to a constituted nation, as Brazil was then, that providence was necessary, the nation of Rio Grande, which is engaged in the struggle defending its independence, has double reason to act likewise.
