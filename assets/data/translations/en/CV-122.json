  "translation": "Caçapava, December 16, 1839\n\nMost Illustrious Sir,\n\nAlthough our acquaintance is very old, and yet not based on closer relations, I am persuaded that it has come to the knowledge of Your Lordship.\n\nDespite this, my views were not fulfilled, and I was forced to submit myself to the greatest of sacrifices and lay upon the altar of the Fatherland any considerations, despite some unfavorable prejudices that may be formed against me, possibly making me the target of certainly unfounded judgments, considering my disinterest, my conduct, and my social affections. A badly conceived opinion about me and without a legitimate foundation rendered all my excuses of no weight, and that is why I submitted only to the law of necessity, a law that greatly prevails over the human spirit. I regret Your Lordship—\n\nI am, with esteem, respect, and consideration, Your Lordship’s\n\nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
