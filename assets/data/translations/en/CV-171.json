  "translation": "My dear old one of the heart. Porto Alegre, April 19, 1835.\n\nYesterday I wrote to you by Vicente, and I have nothing more to add except that at midnight I set off for this place on a large skiff, in which, traveling well, I arrived here in the early morning today, and immediately by nine o’clock I joined the house designated for the sessions of the Assembly, which began today. The city seems good to me, but I suppose I will stay here little, and I already regret having sent the horses back without first sounding out these matters, etc., etc. I am in a famous and large house inhabited only by me and by Xavier Ferreira. Give my regards to all our people, to whom I have not yet written for lack of time, but I will do so by the yacht.\n\nEmbraces to our dear children, and receive the heart of Your old one who loves you dearly.\nAlmeida"
