  "translation": "Most esteemed godfather, friend, and lord,\n\nPiratini, October 31, 1841.\n\nThis letter has solely the object of inquiring about your health and that of my godmother. On the 24th of the current month, I wrote to you by mail and I believe it was delivered; there is no news here, only here appeared a letter for the Lord said to have come from Rio Grande, carried by a Barbosa from Passo das Pedras.\n\nIt was also said that the camels were in Pelotas but, according to what is said, there is nobody here yet; it is true that by the Chapel of the Thieves, a troop appeared and it is said they caught two young men, among whom was a son of a Macedo, who they say enlisted in the infantry.\n\nYour godmother sends her regards most warmly to Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency's godfather and very grateful friend,\nAntônio José de Abreu\n\nMost illustrious and excellent Lord Domingos José de Almeida. Most worthy Bagé.\n\nAnswered on November 5, 1841."
