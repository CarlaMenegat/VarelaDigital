  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nIn compliance with the orders I received from Your Excellency on the 20th of this month, I crossed São Gonçalo with the force I brought from Porto Alegre, and Major Antunes with twenty men, including some officers, and Captain Lucas with two comrades who joined me to go out; and as the news spread that Neto was already waiting for me with more than a thousand men, I requested from the Most Excellent Rio Grande the 8th Battalion to leave at a support point so I could reconnoiter the force, since I could not find a single man for the fire brigade; and marching towards the chapel of Canguçu, where Bento Gonçalves was with two hundred-some men and some senior officers of the Republic, no matter how much effort I made, it was not possible for me to break through unnoticed because the terrain was very populated and all were ragged; as soon as Bento Gonçalves got the news of my march to that town, he gathered everyone and withdrew; seeing that I could do nothing because he was already prepared and my cavalry was very poor, I took care to feed my men and rest the horses, ordering the 8th Battalion I had left for support at Ricardo's pottery to withdraw to the Liscano pass and have Major Antunes and Captain Lucas return with the soldiers they had brought, and withdrawing myself, showing much fear and apprehension of Bento Gonçalves and Neto, marching all night and early morning, and at dawn on the 24th Bento Gonçalves caught up with me on the trails of Guatimim; leaving an ambush in the rear to reconnoiter forces it was seen that a large force was coming on said trails; I lost in this reconnaissance one soldier killed and one mortally wounded; I withdrew again to see if I could balance the numbers of the force, and seeing none at Arroio Grande, I sent Captain Isaías forward with 50-some men to gather horses on the left bank of Camaquã to see if something could be done since my cavalry did not give me the courage to undertake anything; at dawn at the Camaquã pass at Mendonça, I realized the enemy advanced cautiously for having left part of the cavalry behind; I crossed Camaquã to this side, had the inhabitants say I advanced very fearfully of Neto, who they spread was behind me, and at 6 p.m. I withdrew; as soon as it got dark I sent the cavalry with 60 men to the Cordeiro pass and I with the rest of the force counter-marched backward and, setting an ambush near said pass, had the infantry, commanded by Major Queste, form an ambush on the trail, ordering him to let pass 150 to 200 men and then fire on the rear so I could charge from the front; this, as soon as at dawn on the 26th Bento Gonçalves set out on the path of the said pass, Major Queste, letting through the indicated force, fired on their rear, but since it had rained all night and the weapons were wet, they passed again to the other side leaving 5 dead and nearly forty saddled horses. Seeing that they had formed up on the other side, I sent the infantry forward and crossed with the cavalry behind; seeing that I did not cross with more than two hundred cavalry, Bento Gonçalves tried to attack me, and as soon as he saw me separate from the infantry, he charged me with three hundred-some men; but the superiority of their numbers did not help them, as they were completely defeated, leaving on the field 31 dead and twenty prisoners, including one lieutenant-colonel and one lieutenant, these among the dead, and two hundred horses, of which more than eighty were saddled, many. Captain Antônio Cândido da Silva and the brave Ensign Pedro Antônio Iripi and the valiant Sergeant Antônio Correia were immortalized in combat, and seven soldiers wounded, four severely and three lightly, two of the infantry among the severely wounded; the conduct exhibited by Major Queste and his officers and men under his command is worthy of all praise as well as that of the officers and men of the 5th Corps and the Esquadrão do Faxinal, for were it not for the courage and enthusiasm with which they all advanced against the enemy, we would have suffered some setbacks because not only did the enemy attack with over a hundred men but the superiority of their cavalry, due to the poor state of our horses, did not allow me to eliminate the last rebel; Captain Francisco Cabeleira, with his men under his command, I left for protection of the cavalry and even for observation at the pass; the two officers who died are married and poor, and I hope that Your Excellency, august Emperor, will see to granting the pay of their husbands, who so often risked their lives in defense of the throne of His Majesty the Emperor; I am retreating along the coast of the Lagoa dos Patos to dissolve the gatherings that are surely being organized by order of Bento Gonçalves to attack me when I am lost.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.\n\nCapela das Dores, January 29, 1842.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Count of Rio Pardo\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Commander of the Expedition"
