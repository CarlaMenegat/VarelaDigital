  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir Domingos José de Almeida  \nPiratini, March 21, 1841.\n\nI gladly received your esteemed letter dated the 15th of the current month, which gave me great pleasure to know that you enjoyed good health and had made a successful journey; I informed the other gentlemen honored in the same. At present, there is no news here except for the report that Silva intends to defect. On Thursday, the six sons of Dona Joaquina do Pavão and an old man called Rolim were seized in Pelotas. I inform you that with your departure, Sir, and if Sir José Mariano does not take some action, I and many others will not receive it; I am convinced that this gentleman is acting against the orders of the government, according to the decrees and circulars that exist on the matter. A few days ago, I wrote to Your Excellency Erval and I hope he will promptly remedy the situation. My family sends their regards and I particularly do so, being\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s  \nAntônio José de Abreu\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Domingos José de Almeida, Minister of Finance. [On the back] São Gabriel.\n\nReplied on April 11."
