  "translation": "My beloved wife  \nNorte, December 29, 1835.\n\nUnable to travel by boat, since the President has appointed noon today to meet with the Commission of the Provincial Assembly, of which I am a part, I write to you so that you have no worries about me. Perhaps I will travel today itself in a boat if, after the meeting, there is time for it; but this is uncertain.\n\nHugs to all our loved ones and goodbye until then,  \nYour beloved husband, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida — Pelotas."
