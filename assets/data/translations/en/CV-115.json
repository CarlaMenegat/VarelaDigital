  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nColonel Agostinho asks me, in a letter written in great haste, to inform Your Excellency Captain Lima, to join Lieutenant Colonel Aranha; on the morning of the 5th, he was attacked near the Lara estate by an enemy force, and Captain Lima was overwhelmed, escaping with two other officers and eight soldiers, while Lieutenant Saraiva and others were taken prisoner or killed; and as the colonel, because of this movement, not only believes that Lieutenant Colonel Aranha was defeated, but also that communication is cut off in that area, he marched to assemble at Botucaraí, it being likely that the prisoners would admit the small force left at Passo Fundo; and the same Captain Lima states that Candinho with the emigrants was the one who defeated them.\n\nBy the attached letter Your Excellency will see Rio Pardo, further affirming to Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Vila da Cruz Alta, December 7, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Bento Manuel Ribeiro.\n\nRicardo Antônio de Melo e Albuquerque.\n\nFrom the Sir"
