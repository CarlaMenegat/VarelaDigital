  "translation": "We are on the 12th of September Dear Bernardina\n\nAfter having written to you I remembered to tell you that our vicar general asks me for a slave to serve him, as he has none, and if you can spare José for that purpose I would appreciate it. Regarding the slaves from Montevideo, if Ramirez does any trickery, I will collect it from what the State owes him: therefore I am not concerned with what Belém says.\n\nOur small boats captured at Lagoa dos Patos the sloop “Mineira,” very important.\n\nHugs to all and you receive the heart of Yours, Almeida.\n\nLady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida."
