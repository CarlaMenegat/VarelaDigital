  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir, on the 14th of the current month, there appeared in this place, around 7 o’clock in the evening, a slight report that the wicked legalists from Cima da Serra had entered here; the police gathered at the same hour and numbered 12 men; I sent them outside the village, remaining myself; and when day broke on the 15th, with the troop, opening the door I encountered the enemy, and I had no choice but to stop; at this moment Lieutenant José Jacinto appeared in the field, who was patrolling the village on reconnaissance, and upon discovering the enemy he withdrew with 6 men towards the police side, and the enemy charged upon him, and this lieutenant who finds it difficult to turn his back on the enemy, charged upon him, resulting in his being gravely wounded, as well as an enemy officer; and when it was about 9 o’clock of the day, they immediately retreated to Cima da Serra, doing no further damage, perhaps supposing there was a force nearby, their commander being (a force of about 100 men) Ensign Padilha, Lieutenant João Batista de Oliveira, Lieutenant Bueno, and the police commander of São Martinho, all from Cima da Serra, whom Padilha had concealed, this assembly having been arranged by the said police commander and the aforesaid Oliveira. And today a soldier of citizen Colonel Agostinho appeared here with an open letter from his wife to the said colonel who is said to be in Rio Pardo, the soldier carried an order, which I enclose herewith to Your Excellency at Cruz Alta, the comrade having informed me of the outcome at Cruz Alta, that while conducting dispatches to Colonel Agostinho Botucaraí, the person mentioned in the order directed that the dispatches he carried be confiscated, and that seeing Melo Brabo attack the Police of Cruz Alta, the said police fled, crossing the Estrada do Cadeado, and that they seized all the horses, proceeding thereafter to São Xavier. The same soldier says that Melo, father of Lieutenant Colonel Antônio de Melo e Albuquerque, had delivered the Treasury money and paid the men who assembled at Cruz Alta, which amounted to about 200, leaving at Passo Fundo the force that had come from Vacaria commanded by one Candinho; and I, Most Excellent Sir,\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency safe. Capela de Santa Maria, December 16, 1839 Most Illustrious and Excellent José Gomes Porto, justice of the peace.\n\nIt is accurate. Alencastre\n\nCopy attached to document CV-127."
