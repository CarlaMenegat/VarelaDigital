  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nHaving been quite preoccupied, I have neglected my duty to respond to the letter from Your Lordship dated the 25th of November of this year, and as our comrades assured me that they participated in everything that occurred, that I should proceed to secure our frontier, and I was convinced that this was so by those who requested that I send to Your Lordship Ibicuí; one night Brigadier Bento Manuel joined me, bringing with him 30 men, and on another the Sergeant-Major Jacinto Guedes, bringing with him over a hundred men; this gathering took place at Carvaraci, where I was with the few forces I had; we soon marched upon Mingote and Siqueira, where we lost 2 men and the enemy 9, with the commander of my force leading the attack; Major Carneiro immediately afterward marched upon Loureiro and I found nothing, because on the night of Brigadier Bento Manuel’s arrival, Loureiro, as I think he learned, retreated to the other side, for the next day we attacked Mingote and on our return we found our men who had been lost on the other side, which also happened on the same day that we attacked here; I do not explain more about treaties and plans because I asked Mr. Prado, President of the Chamber, to explain to Your Lordship the tax office. Even now I am preparing a batch of gunpowder to send to Your Lordship.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship. Camp at Ibirapuitã, December 2, 1837.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira,\nColonel Commander of the Right Division.\n\nJosé Inácio da Silva Abreu,\nLieutenant-Colonel Interim Commander of the Frontier."
