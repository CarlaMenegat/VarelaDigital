  "translation": "My dear godfather and friend  \nPiratini, November 20, 1841.\n\nI have received your esteemed letter of the 16th of this month, accompanied by the official document for Dutra, which I will deliver to him as soon as possible; it seems unnecessary to thank you for this favor, because there have been so many I have received that I think I may already have tired you, yet nevertheless I do not give up, confident in your benevolent spirit and in how much you strive to be useful not only to your friends but to all humanity; I am certain I will proceed to that place as soon as Your Excellency  \n\nNow, I have to inform you that the Galegos on the 17th of this month disembarked in Pelotas with their new General Valente, who is brave only in name; they are said to have let loose one battalion and a small force of cavalry; if this is peace, what will war be like; at any rate, peace must be like that of the nuns that Your Excellency  \n\nThey say that Father Chagas is going there to reside as Pro.cor, which took quite some effort to decide; there is much complaint about Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency  \n\nYour goddaughter sends you a hug, as well as to my esteemed godmother. Your godmother and I commend ourselves greatly to you, as do Dona Custodinha, Bruto, and the rest of the family.\n\nFeel free to command one who has the satisfaction of being  \nOf Your Excellency  \nAntônio José de Abreu\n\nReplied on November 30, 1841.\n\nTo citizen Domingos José de Almeida. Bagé."
