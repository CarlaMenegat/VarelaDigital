  "translation": "THE CITIZEN DOMINGOS JOSÉ DE ALMEIDA TO HIS COMPATRIOTS\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, 1835: PRINTING HOUSE OF V. F. DE ANDRADE, RUA DA PONTE.\n\nPEOPLE OF RIO GRANDE! So that our brothers from the other provinces of the Empire may assess the nature of this fierce and perverse party that supported and directed the administration of Mr. Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga, which your virtues and patriotism have just overcome, I will disclose the reasons that led to my imprisonment and all that occurred in the tormenting seventeen days during which I was confined in the narrow chamber of the war schooner “19 de Outubro,” so that you may see with horror the fate that awaited you, had the tutelary genius of Brazil abandoned the Holy Cause you defend.\n\nWell aware of your just indignation against an anti-national, despotic, turbulent, and wasteful administration such as that of Mr. Braga, as soon as I learned of the movements of September 20 in the capital, I enlisted in your ranks, protesting to die with you or save the Fatherland from the monsters that oppressed it.\n\nFirm in this purpose and confident in the feelings of the officers and national guards under my command, in the patriotism of the meritorious Major Pinto, Captain Pinto, Lieutenant Pinto, and Ensign Felizardo, of the infantry of the city of Pelotas, and above all in the Brazilianism of Major José Jerônimo do Amaral, officers and national guards of the squadron under his command, I drafted the initial outlines of the plan to follow, to immediately blunt the intrigues of Mr. Braga, in case, in a futile effort at resistance, he wanted to involve us in the horrors of anarchy, when, encouraged by advice received in Rio Grande, the said Mr. appeared in the city of Pelotas, a worthy colony of the reactionaries of our Province, unfurling the banner of civil war.\n\nThe quarrelsome scuffles caused by… at Mr. Braga’s landing immediately intensified the factions; and just as I was considering means to avoid premature clashes, around eleven o’clock at night, part of the squadron under my command appeared requesting my assistance to arrest Mr. Braga. Nothing could have been easier at the time; however, nothing was more disagreeable to liberals. The matter became serious in view of the reasons I opposed, and it was necessary to follow a course of action to prevent calamities. It occurred to me to present myself in the city with that force and engage the Chamber to, under this pretext, entreat Mr. Braga to desist from his futile plans to resist the will of the majority of the Province. With these views, I took the lead of the force and appeared in the city, where I was soon joined by part of the infantry, the major and officers of the 12th Company of the National Guard, who also breathed the desire to arrest Mr. Braga. The judge of law appeared too weary of armed men, which provoked several outbursts that could have escalated had I not intervened by cheering for the cause of the veneration of Brazilians.\n\nAfter calming the judge, I was able to convince him of the necessity of a conference between him and some other reputable persons of the city, which took place at his own house. In this conference it was agreed that no representations should be made to Mr. Braga, that only municipal police matters should be addressed to avoid disorder in the crisis we were facing, keeping the city in expectation, without aligning with parties, so as not to compromise oneself or attract the hatred of the winner. Aspiring to no more, having thus saved victims, I returned with my companions, whom I ordered to disperse one league outside the city. In this same month— good order emphasized in the original — they were to bolster the ranks of Major Marques, the first vanguard of legalism. My companions twice sought me out, complaining of betrayal; I demanded explanations from one of the conference members; this was given, denying the rumor of an arrest; shortly after, I was informed that the city was in consternation, saying that, knowing I was to be arrested, I was marching with my people to take revenge; I also denied this assertion, and we all calmed down. Two days later, one of the conference members approached me and warned that, given the ill will that had arisen against me throughout the city, I should be cautious, although he promised to inform me of any news or orders regarding me. Hardly had this compassionate soul left me than I learned that a young servant of mine, whom I had sent to Arroio Grande when I conceived the plan to make Mr. desist from attempting to resist the general will of the Province, to withdraw the national force stationed there so as to avoid bloodshed if it should confront Major Marques's forces, had been imprisoned since the previous day for delivering letters to the Chambers of this city and of Rio Grande.\n\nSuch a precedent, apparently concealed to keep me off guard, as later facts proved, so they could seize me, relying on the faithfulness of the promised intelligence, was not enough to shield me from the trap laid for me; such was my good faith and sincerity in all I had done. On the night of this same day (October 4), between seven and eight o’clock, while I was in my courtyard enjoying the moonlight, surrounded by my family and guests, three horsemen arrived and, one of them asking for me, I promptly approached him as he dismounted. He, in a submissive voice, gave me recommendations from my esteemed friend Captain Antônio Neto, from whom, having to communicate—Neto could arrive with the people he brought—I had the imprudence to disclose the state of affairs regarding the current movement. Afterwards, asking me to accompany him to speak with the very Neto, who had remained behind the hedges of my farm, was when I realized my imprudence and asked him who he was, to which, answering haltingly, he said he was Nico de Oliveira; and, given the glaring disparities between them, I considered myself doomed, thinking I was in the presence of the assassins of the…\n\nIn such a situation, it was necessary to obey silently, so as not to stab my wife, who was at the door observing us and still recovering from childbirth thirty-four days prior, with the dagger of despair. Behind the hedges, I found a detachment of ten men on horseback, on one of whom my captor made me ride just as my wife was approaching, to whom he ordered to fire if she took another step forward, and commanded us to proceed to the city. Halfway there, we turned back to arrest the citizen Antônio Antunes de Porciúncula, my faithful companion and friend, from whose house he dispatched me in the company of three of his henchmen to prison, while the rest stayed with my captor awaiting the said Antunes, who was not found. On this departure, I bravely awaited my assassination, when my conductor, perhaps moved by such harsh procedures, whispered to me—rest assured, I will set you free immediately once we reach the enclosure of…—and spurred the horse. Shortly after, we heard a shot, and soon after the gallop of horsemen following us: the moonlight was very bright, and we were in a clearing from which we could not stray without being detected.\n\nThis caused us unease, justified by the voices we heard from afar of my captor ordering his men to gallop because there were many of them. Senhor Cândido Fernandes Lima, justice of the peace of the 2nd District, I turned to the direction from which he was coming and saw him heading toward the detachment with a lady. I was already inside Rua da Igreja when I noticed that my wife was that lady who came with Senhor Cândido, lamenting not seeing me and fearing me dead. I then begged my captor to allow me to speak to my wife to remove the illusion that so distressed her, when this monster with a human face, drawing a large pistol that he carried, hurled it at the head of the person who was escorting me, shouting—move forward or I’ll blow your head off!— People of Rio Grande! and all of you who love your wives, imagine my pain and despair at the sight of my overwhelmed wife and such an unjust and inhuman act! Where, where would one see such harshness and cruelty, if not among the possessed friends of good order emphasized in the original, defenders of the administration of the most foolish Mr. Braga!!!\n\nAs if stunned, I only recovered myself when placed in the middle of a large gathering of good and armed people, who waited for the rich prey in front of the barracks of the Permanents… There, full of emphasis, my captor addressed the municipal judge with an arrogant tone, as if proclaiming, the following speech—there he is, let him escape and I will abandon everything!— The judge, appearing surprised, demanded to know by whose order I had been arrested, to which the brave assassin of General Pantaleão Sutelo when betrayed to be robbed in 1820 replied—that it was by order of the President. Surrounded by arms, at the first acquaintance I encountered, Senhor—I asked him to look for my disconsolate wife and assure her of my existence, showing my tobacco box to prove it; this gentleman not only did me this important favor, which I will always remember gratefully,\n\nThe ferocity stood out in this shining assembly, a faithful organ of the nature of the Braga supporters. A carpenter officer named Joaquim José de Sousa, who at the time was working at my house and had the indiscretion to accompany my wife when she, distraught, went through the streets seeking me, and offered her footwear, was, for such a huge crime, arrested at the very moment I informed of it with shows of sympathy; from which imprisonment he escaped, accepting a weapon and joining the ranks of justice emphasized in the original. The same fate befell Senhor, who, recognized for favors he says I rendered him when he came from Pernambuco, had the audacity to express sentiments to me upon seeing me in that state; and the very illustrious Senhor, leader of this holy party and fully worthy of it, tormented me with jeers… which, with great effort, I was able to bear in silence. Regaining some calmness, amid the storm of vehement emotions, I sought to inquire who my most humane captor was, and my indignation then rose sharply, being told it was the notorious Basílio Ferreira Bica, my old friend in São Gabriel!!! But he had embraced the cause of good order emphasized in the original, and that alone was enough to make him fierce. On the morning of the 5th, and despite the municipal judge’s promise that I would be guarded even in his house—to better receive the consolations of my wife and children—I was summoned to follow immediately to the steamer, to be transported to Rio Grande.\n\nThe judge’s promise made me refrain from sending for clothes from my house with which I might appear decent; and so, with a muddied muleteer and wearing only what I had on, I accompanied the judges of peace and inspectors charged with taking me. The force marched after the cheers given to Senhor, to the Constitution, etc., mixed with the Commander Bica and the municipal judge; and we continued in this direction. Senhor Cândido Fernandes Lima, people of Rio Grande, not only provided me with a good bundle of clothes but also with a bill of 100$000, an act that even while writing this makes tears of gratitude well up in my eyes, and I gladly recommend him to your respect and esteem, as well as Senhor João Rodrigues Ribas, who, as I boarded the steamer, sent me 50 patacões: aid I accepted, already foreseeing the fate I had to run under the wrath of the most idiotic and evil of the warlords, namely Mr. Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga. Shortly after we cast off, the national guards of the infantry who guarded me informed me that Major José de Melo Pacheco de Resende, who was on the same steamer, but whom I had not yet seen as I was already confined, was telling anyone who wanted to hear that, in the letters intercepted to my subordinate foreman, who also followed me in imprisonment, I was commanded to incite a slave revolt, thus turning against me, as he did, with such atrocious and vile slander! It is surprising, however, that Major Melo would make such a claim, because if such a plan existed, he should necessarily have been invited, as no one was a slave more than the major himself, etc… We reached Vila do Norte and finally docked in the city of Rio Grande around three in the afternoon; there I believe they would have strangled me if the door of the steamer’s salon had not been guarded by the national guards who accompanied me: for the swarm of parasites of good order emphasized in the original and their whispering was such that their damned intentions were easily foreseen, and I recognized them very particularly when, upon jumping into the skiff that took me to my prison, a voice rose saying—shoot the good order emphasized in the original.!! The one who wanted to dominate this province, homeland of heroes, with very rare exceptions!!! On the voyage from the North to Rio Grande I also learned that Second Lieutenant Luís Alves dos Santos Marques, who was at the dock of the North when the steamer arrived, had promised to chain me with the heaviest shackle if I fell into his hands; and, as I headed for the schooner under his command, I trembled thinking of the torments awaiting me; but, in fairness, I must say that despite the austere manner in which he received and treated me during my imprisonment, not allowing me to serve myself with my slave, not permitting visits from my friends, only allowing me to go out on deck for fresh air three times, and not letting me address anyone by letter or paper without it first being read and corrected by him, still I had the freedom to eat when I wished and what there was, and for that alone I am grateful to him.\n\nAlmost all the conversations he had with me revolved around the prosperous state of Senhor’s defenders, and anyone can judge my interest in that wild and ferocious horde. On the fifth day of my imprisonment, among other things to console me, he said that the ill will against me was so great that they had even asked him to poison me; and, although I did not think him capable of complying with that inhuman suggestion, fearing some attempt I could not resist, I immediately asked to be sent to Rio de Janeiro, where, outside the influence of the wild legalists emphasized in the original, I would be safe from assassins and relieved from torments, though further from seven innocent children and my consort. To confirm all this, I was informed by my wife that a debtor of mine and two of my creditors, erecting themselves into something only they can name, the day following my imprisonment had circulated documents to seize my house.\n\nThis dishonorable step—good order emphasized in the original—at the moment the world was closed to me and a revolution closed the door to all transactions, clearly shows the intention to wrest from me for five what might be worth a hundred, leaving my family exposed to hunger and destitution, and me to the curse of absent creditors.\n\nWeighed down by this news and melancholic reflections on the harshness and nature of a political party that breathed nothing but atrocities, tears wet my face, foreseeing the fate awaiting the flower of the Province if the fortunes of arms favored these unrestrained cannibals when, placing a table in the center of the room of my narrow prison, came in and sat the Dr. José Vieira Braga and his clerk; from the former I was told he came to interrogate me about my crimes, and then he did, asking what was my purpose in going with armed force to the city of Pelotas, given that, in a speech delivered at the Provincial Assembly, I had promised to make a revolution, and I was proving by facts my promise. To this, I answered that my trip to the city of Pelotas had no other purpose than to check the horrors of anarchy, making it clear to Señor that his stubbornness against the opinion of the majority of the Province, besides being ridiculous, would compromise peaceful citizens and ignite endless and ruinous rivalries. As for my speech, I saw no reason why that figure, which I then used, could apply to the Province’s movements and even less constitute a crime; being not responsible for the opinions I expressed as a deputy in the Provincial Assembly hall. Disagreeing, the judge continued that in the same Assembly I had stated that the day of vengeance would come; and that with the revolution against the authority I had referred to then, it was to be presumed that such an adventurous threat was based on foundations that should not fail. Weary of a dialogue irrelevant to the matter, even though sufficient to show me the cause of my crimes, Senhor, did not see the edges collide, calling upon the vengeance of the inhabitants of an entire Province, tired of enduring him and resolved to resist if he continued in foolhardiness as well as in ordering my case to be tried twice in foreign jurisdiction; for having my domicile in the city of Pelotas, and being imprisoned in the dock of Vila do Norte, I was transferred to the court of the city of Rio Grande, where he more easily found elements to satisfy his perverse, rancorous, and vindictive spirit, hiding under the appearance of a lamb. The judge left, and I, given to my usual reflections, said: if the picture of a wife about to succumb and the innocent tears of tender children do not soften the rage of the wicked, what fate awaits most of my fellow provincials, if by some unforeseen event this monster again assumes the supreme command of the Province!! What devastations… what heaps of ruins!! Luckily these ideas had not yet faded from my mind when the roar of numerous rockets once again plunged me into painful distress. The blood of Brazilians, shed at the banks of Arroio Grande by Brazilians, was announced with such a thunderous noise in the city of Rio Grande by the friends of good order emphasized in the original that even today its memory makes even the coldest heart throb with indignation. The preparations, however, for a prompt journey immediately following this unbridled joy, informed me enough—there even in the darkness of my prison—that heaven had finally heard the calls of justice. My hardships doubled; paper and ink were withheld from me; and I departed for the harbor without bidding farewell to my dear family. There, resigned even to violent murder, cut off by pain, I awaited the moment to leave perhaps forever this blessed province, leaving behind everything, after the homeland, that is dearest to me.\n\nOn the fifth day of such an existence, Senhor Braga, Major Manuel Marques de Sousa appeared, who, unlike others of his creed, spoke to me and showed surprise that I was still imprisoned and promised me immediate freedom if I spoke to the Commander of the gunboats, making me feel at the same time that it would be useful for me to be at home that same day, if possible. This assertion threw me again into agitated plans, thinking there had been some misfortune in my family, and exposing to Senator Marques such fear, he was kind enough to dissipate it, saying he saw in my imprisonment a pretext for persecutions and cruel reprisals, and that he had expressed himself that way, and that I could avoid violence by appearing.\n\nHe went to the President; half an hour later, a deputation from the Municipal Chamber of the city of Rio Grande went to the same residence; shortly after, the commander of the schooner, who was also there, returned and, showing pleasure, announced to me that I was free and a skiff at my disposal for my return. However, just as the trunks of my suit were being removed, Senhor Manuel Gomes da Silva, member of the Chamber and of the aforementioned deputation, came, who, approaching me with his characteristic mildness, made me see that he had come to fetch me following a requisition from the respectable body of which he was a part. Deeply moved, I prepared to follow him. But the commander of the schooner, objecting to my going with Senhor Gomes, caused me distress, suspecting the news of my release was a trick to mock my credulity and the Chamber's requisition. Senhor Gomes, I believe the same Senhor Braga, gave his word of honor that I was free, and, confronted with the obstacle of taking me with him, having come for no other purpose, returned to Senhor Braga to impose the reasons opposing my departure; and the commander then agreed to wait until I dressed; Senhor Israel then arrived at the schooner, who, after a brief interview with the commander, called me aside and explained that, having Senhor Gomes indiscreetly told Senhor Braga that a large portion of the citizens of the city, and the troops, and the colonel, were impatiently waiting for me at the dock, he orally ordered the commander not to let me leave with Senhor Gomes, particularly because the Chamber then already denied his authority and wanted to show that I was not released on his claims but by virtue of Marques's information, presenting me afterward the release order, which indeed referred to said Marques! Suspecting everything I witnessed, given Senhor Braga’s fickleness, I nevertheless asked Senhor Gomes to return, under the pretext that I had to take time to finalize business with an emigrant but would follow two or three hours later.\n\nSenhor Gomes left, and I, disheartened, prepared to follow him from afar, expecting that upon boarding the skiff new orders would detain me; and though I was mistaken, I still had to overcome placing myself out of range of the schooner’s shots.\n\nOnce in the skiff, as soon as I sat down and was no longer heard from the schooner, I managed to convince the crew not to return, even if pursued by gunfire, heading to the nearest shore where, safe from shots and breathing safely, I proceeded to the city of Rio Grande, whose inhabitants and outsiders received me in such a way that I felt abundantly rewarded for all I had suffered. The next day (the 23rd), Vila do Norte, where also against resistance its inhabitants showed pleasure at my freedom. On the 24th I arrived home, where, surrounded by wife and children and free from the Braga brutality, we portrayed for a long time the most pathetic scene; and on the 25th, in the city of Pelotas, my friends and friends of freedom fulfilled my joy by the satisfaction reflected on their faces to see me restored to their arms.\n\nPEOPLE OF RIO GRANDE! With my release, you have gained yet another triumph over the enemies of the Fatherland, but do not think your noble works are complete without total forgetting of the past and generous forgiveness of the deluded to drive the wagon of the revolution towards the ends proposed. Therefore, do not stain the most perfect work by your hands with intrigues and hateful dissensions. Let us all embrace, all the inhabitants of the Continent, and direct our efforts firmly to a single goal—what is good for the Fatherland!\n\nPelotas, October 29, 1835.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nPorto Alegre, 1835: Printing House of V.
