                    <em>Varela Digital</em> is a digital scholarly edition and knowledge-oriented research environment dedicated
                    to the correspondence preserved in the Varela Collection, held by the Arquivo Histórico do Rio Grande do Sul.
                    Developed within a broader historical investigation of the Farroupilha Revolution (1835–1845), the project
                    publishes a representative portion of this corpus through TEI/XML encoding, structured metadata, and semantic modelling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Varela correspondence offers a privileged perspective on how the rebellion was governed and negotiated in practice:
                    orders, requests, mediation, and administrative routines appear side by side with private communication.
                    In particular, the letters make visible the transregional dimension of the conflict by documenting cross-border
                    networks linking Rio Grande do Sul to Uruguay and the wider Río de la Plata world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The edition is based on the printed transcriptions published in the <em>Anais do Arquivo Histórico do Rio Grande do Sul</em>.
                    While the collection comprises more than 550 documentary units, this project focuses on a pilot corpus of
                    300 documents (CV-1 to CV-300), starting from Volume II (1978), the first <em>Anais</em> volume to publish Varela materials.
                    Beyond access to texts, <em>Varela Digital</em> models persons, places, events, and relations across documents using Linked Open Data,
                    enabling navigation, indexing, and future spatial and network visualizations grounded in historical interpretation.

                <p>
                    The Farroupilha Revolution (also known as the Ragamuffin War) was a prolonged political and military conflict
                    fought in the southern province of Rio Grande do Sul between 1835 and 1845. Emerging in the turbulent decades
                    following Brazilian independence, the rebellion developed within a wider crisis of imperial governance:
                    provincial elites negotiated, resisted, and reshaped the reach of a still-consolidating central state.
                    In Rio Grande do Sul, these tensions intersected with a frontier economy, militarized local society,
                    and long-standing disputes over fiscal policy, military command, and the distribution of political authority.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although often narrated through the lens of regionalism, the Farroupilha conflict cannot be reduced to a local
                    episode. It mobilized competing projects of legitimacy and sovereignty, and it produced concrete experiments in
                    rebel administration—taxation, policing, military recruitment, diplomatic representation, and everyday governance.
                    The documentary record also reveals a war shaped by contingency: shifting alliances, internal factionalism,
                    pragmatic negotiations, and the constant need to secure resources, transport, and communication across a vast
                    territory.

                <h3>1. Political background in the Empire of Brazil</h3>
                <p>
                    The revolt unfolded during a period marked by political instability and the redefinition of the imperial order.
                    Debates over decentralization, provincial autonomy, and the limits of central authority informed how actors
                    justified rebellion, framed grievances, and negotiated reconciliation. In this context, political language
                    often blended constitutional arguments with practical concerns: who could appoint commanders, collect revenue,
                    regulate commerce, and enforce justice in a border province where military power and civil administration were
                    deeply intertwined.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Rio Grande do Sul as a frontier society</h3>
                <p>
                    Rio Grande do Sul was not only a peripheral province; it was a strategic frontier zone. Its economy depended on
                    cattle-raising, charque production, and regional trade networks, while its society was shaped by mobility,
                    militarization, and contested boundaries. These conditions affected both the causes and the course of the conflict.
                    The war’s logistics—horses, troops, weapons, supplies, and routes—were inseparable from local landholding patterns,
                    labor relations, and the ability of families and communities to sustain prolonged mobilization.
                </p>

                <h3>3. War and rebel government</h3>
                <p>
                    The Farroupilha Revolution produced forms of rebel governance that combined improvisation and institutional
                    ambition. Letters document administrative routines and urgent decisions: issuing orders, responding to reports,
                    directing movements, negotiating provisions, and managing justice and policing. They also expose the human texture
                    of governance during wartime, in which political ideals coexisted with scarcity, uncertainty, and the constant need
                    to maintain authority across dispersed and often unstable local command structures.
                </p>

                        Varela Collection.

                </figure>

                <h3>4. A transnational conflict: Uruguay and the Río de la Plata</h3>
                <p>
                    The rebellion’s trajectory was profoundly shaped by cross-border dynamics. Rio Grande do Sul was connected to
                    Uruguay and the broader Río de la Plata world through kinship networks, exile routes, military circulation, and
                    political negotiations. Farroupilha actors engaged with shifting factions across the border, relying on diplomacy,
                    personal mediation, and strategic alliances. The correspondence preserved in the Varela Collection is especially
                    valuable for reconstructing these interactions, since letters register not only formal positions but also informal
                    channels of information and influence.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Why correspondence matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Letters are not merely sources that “report” events; they are instruments that made the war governable.
                    They record decisions in formation, conflicts in real time, and the practical work of sustaining authority through
                    writing. For this reason, the Varela Collection—predominantly composed of personal and administrative correspondence—
                    offers an exceptional entry point into the Farroupilha Revolution as lived political practice: negotiation, command,
                    persuasion, and the management of networks across space.
                </p>

                <h2>Correspondence as a historical source</h2>

                <p>
                    Correspondence occupies a central place in the historical study of the nineteenth century,
                    particularly in contexts marked by political instability, territorial fragmentation, and
                    fragile institutional structures. Letters functioned simultaneously as instruments of
                    communication, administration, negotiation, and authority, allowing actors to govern,
                    coordinate, and justify actions across distance. In the context of the Farroupilha Revolution,
                    written correspondence was not merely a record of events but a constitutive element of political
                    and military practice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The documents preserved in the Varela Collection reflect this multifunctional character.
                    Personal letters coexist with administrative orders, reports, requests, and endorsements,
                    often within the same exchange. These texts register decisions in formation, shifts in
                    allegiance, logistical constraints, and strategies of persuasion, revealing how political
                    authority was exercised through writing in a frontier society shaped by war, mobility,
                    and negotiation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From a historiographical perspective, correspondence offers access to temporal processes
                    rather than retrospective narratives. Letters are produced under conditions of uncertainty:
                    they anticipate outcomes, respond to incomplete information, and attempt to influence
                    future actions. This makes them particularly valuable for reconstructing networks of
                    interaction, chains of command, and the circulation of information, but also challenging
                    to interpret when treated as isolated texts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These characteristics make correspondence especially suited to a data-oriented approach.
                    Letters are inherently relational documents: they presuppose senders and recipients, refer
                    to places, events, institutions, and other individuals, and are embedded in sequences of
                    exchange. Modeling correspondence as structured data allows these relations to be made
                    explicit, connected across documents, and analyzed beyond the linear reading of individual
                    texts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In <em>Varela Digital</em>, correspondence is therefore treated not only as a textual genre
                    but as a relational infrastructure. TEI/XML encoding captures the internal structure of
                    letters and their editorial mediation, while semantic modeling expresses the historical
                    relations articulated through writing—between persons, institutions, events, and places.
                    This approach bridges traditional historical analysis and computational representation,
                    enabling new forms of navigation, comparison, and interpretation grounded in the sources
                    themselves.

                <h2>The Varela Collection and its formation</h2>

                <p>
                    The Varela Collection is the result of a long and layered process of accumulation rather than a
                    single archival initiative. Its formation reflects successive moments of preservation, expansion,
                    and institutionalization linked to the memory of the Farroupilha Revolution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The core of the collection originated in the personal archive of Domingos José de Almeida, one of
                    the central political leaders of the rebellion. During and after the conflict, Almeida preserved
                    correspondence and administrative documents related to the revolutionary government and its
                    networks. Although he intended to write a history of the Farroupilha Revolution, this project was
                    never completed, and the documents remained within the family after his death.
                </p>

                        Domingos José de Almeida, one of the central political figures of the Farroupilha Revolution
                        and original nucleus of what would later become the Varela Collection.

                <p>
                    In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the archive was transferred to Alfredo
                    Varela, who substantially expanded the original corpus by incorporating documents from other
                    private sources. Through this process, a personal archive linked to a single political actor was
                    transformed into a broader documentary collection associated with the rebellion as a whole.
                    Varela’s collecting practices contributed to shaping both the scope of the collection and its
                    retrospective interpretation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 1936, during the centennial commemorations of the Farroupilha Revolution, the collection was
                    donated to the government of Rio Grande do Sul and incorporated into public custody. It was
                    initially housed within the State Museum and later became part of the Arquivo Histórico do Rio
                    Grande do Sul, established as an independent institution in 1954. From that moment on, the
                    collection underwent processes of archival organization, description, and editorial mediation,
                    culminating in its publication in the <em>Anais do Arquivo Histórico do Rio Grande do Sul</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recognizing this trajectory is essential for interpreting the documents preserved in the Varela
                    Collection. The corpus reflects multiple historical layers: the immediacy of revolutionary
                    correspondence, the logic of a personal archive, the interventions of a private collector, and
                    the institutional frameworks of twentieth-century archival preservation. <em>Varela Digital</em>
                    engages with this complexity by treating the collection as a historically constructed object,
                    rather than as a neutral repository of sources.

                <p>
                    The present project begins with Volume II of the <em>Anais</em>, published in 1978, which is the first
                    volume to include documents from the Varela Collection related to the Farroupilha Revolution.
                    This volume contains the initial segment of the active correspondence, numbered CV-1 to CV-558,
                    and establishes the editorial conventions that structure subsequent volumes of the series.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although the Secretariat of Culture of Rio Grande do Sul has made the volumes of the <em>Anais</em>
                    available online in PDF format, the digital reproduction of Volume II is incomplete, and the printed
                    edition has long been out of circulation. These conditions limit accessibility and reuse, particularly
                    for systematic analysis, indexing, and cross-document research.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For methodological reasons <em>Varela Digital</em>
                    focuses on a pilot corpus of 300 documents, corresponding to CV-1 through CV-300. This selection
                    allows for the full implementation and testing of editorial encoding, semantic annotation, and
                    data modeling workflows, while remaining representative of the documentary typologies, authors,
                    and historical contexts present in the collection as a whole.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By re-encoding this pilot corpus as a structured digital edition and knowledge-oriented resource,
                    the project does not aim to replace the <em>Anais</em>, but rather to complement them. The digital
                    edition preserves the editorial mediation of the printed volumes while extending their analytical
                    potential through machine-readable structure, explicit semantic relations, and future visualizations.

            <section id="modelling" class="vd-section">
                <h2>From context to digital modelling</h2>

                <p>
                    The historical characteristics of the Varela correspondence—its relational density, its
                    administrative hybridity, and its grounding in everyday political practice—directly inform
                    the digital modelling choices adopted in <em>Varela Digital</em>. Rather than treating letters
                    as isolated textual artifacts, the project approaches them as nodes within a broader
                    historical system composed of people, institutions, places, events, and acts of communication.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This perspective motivates the combined use of TEI/XML encoding and Linked Open Data
                    technologies. TEI provides a structured representation of the textual and editorial features
                    of each document, preserving the organization of the printed edition while making explicit
                    elements such as senders, recipients, dates, places, and internal textual divisions.
                    At the same time, semantic modelling enables the representation of historical relations
                    expressed in the correspondence—social, institutional, political, and event-based—across
                    documents and beyond the boundaries of individual letters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By translating historically grounded entities and relations into interoperable data models,
                    <em>Varela Digital</em> transforms contextual knowledge into a navigable and extensible
                    research environment. This approach supports advanced indexing, cross-document exploration,
                    and future visualizations of spatial circulation and social networks, while remaining
                    anchored in the close reading and critical interpretation of primary sources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The result is a knowledge-oriented digital edition in which historical context and digital
                    structure are not separate layers but mutually reinforcing components. Modelling becomes
                    an interpretative act, shaped by historiographical questions and archival realities, and
                    the digital edition functions not only as a medium of access but as a tool for historical
                    inquiry.
