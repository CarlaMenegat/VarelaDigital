            <h2>Scope and rationale</h2>
            <h3><em>Varela Digital</em> as a scholarly edition and knowledge environment</h3>

            <p>
              <em>Varela Digital</em> is conceived as a scholarly digital edition that goes beyond the online presentation
              of historical texts. It combines established practices in digital scholarly editing with data modelling and
              semantic representation, transforming the edition into a knowledge-oriented research environment. Documents
              are not treated as isolated textual artefacts, but as historical objects situated within networks of people,
              places, institutions, events, and actions.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project adopts core principles of digital scholarly editing—transparency of editorial intervention,
              explicit modelling choices, and reproducibility—while extending them through TEI/XML encoding and Linked
              Open Data–oriented structures. Textual encoding serves both interpretive and analytical purposes: it records
              editorial decisions and enables the formalisation of historical information that can be reused, aggregated,
              and visualised across the corpus.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although correspondence constitutes the dominant genre within the Varela Collection, <em>Varela Digital</em>
              does not reduce the corpus to letters alone. The data model accommodates the collection’s heterogeneity,
              including administrative, legal, and financial documents, which coexist organically within the archival
              assemblage. The centrality of the letter model reflects the empirical structure of the corpus and the
              analytical focus of the pilot phase, rather than a restrictive editorial choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              From a Digital Humanities perspective, the project sits at the intersection of scholarly editing and
              knowledge representation. The resulting knowledge base supports multiple modes of exploration: sequential
              reading in the viewer, access through structured indexes, and analysis through spatial and network
              visualisations derived from explicitly modelled relations.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- Section B -->
          <section id="kb" class="vd-section">
            <h2>Knowledge base</h2>

            <p>
              <em>Varela Digital</em> is conceived not only as a digital scholarly edition, but as a knowledge-oriented
              research environment. Its primary objective is to model historical correspondence in a way that preserves
              textual integrity while making explicit the relations embedded in and across documents. In this sense, the
              project aligns with digital editions that treat texts, metadata, and contextual entities as interconnected
              components of a structured knowledge base.
            </p>

            <p>
              The knowledge base is built through the combination of TEI/XML encoding, structured authority files, and
              Linked Open Data principles. Documents, persons, places, and institutions are represented as entities and
              connected through historically meaningful relations. This allows users to move beyond document-by-document
              consultation and to explore patterns of communication, administrative practices, and political networks
              articulated through correspondence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than prioritising exhaustive semantic querying through a public SPARQL endpoint, the project focuses
              on interpretive affordances that emerge from structured data. These include dynamic indexes, spatial
              visualisations of correspondence circulation, and network representations of relationships among historical
              actors. Together, these components support historical inquiry by making relations visible, navigable, and
              analysable, while keeping documents anchored in their archival and editorial contexts.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this configuration, the knowledge base does not function as a neutral repository of facts, but as a
              mediated scholarly construct. It supports historically grounded questions about communication, power, and
              governance during the Farroupilha Revolution, while remaining transparent about its methodological and
              editorial assumptions.

            <h2>Editorial and interpretive stance</h2>

            <p>
              <em>Varela Digital</em> adopts an editorial stance that sits between a traditional scholarly edition and what may be
              described as a knowledge-oriented edition. The project is grounded in rigorous textual encoding and explicit editorial
              decisions, but its primary goal is not to reconstruct an “ideal” textual state. Instead, it aims to make documents
              usable as historical evidence within a structured digital environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              This approach requires a clear distinction between documentary fidelity and interpretive mediation. The texts presented in
              <em>Varela Digital</em> are based on the printed transcriptions published in the <em>Anais do Arquivo Histórico do Rio Grande do Sul</em>,
              rather than on direct manuscript collation. For this reason, the edition does not claim to be diplomatic with respect to the original
              handwritten documents. Editorial choices from the printed edition are preserved, and this decision is explicitly documented.
            </p>

            <p>
              Editorial transparency is treated as a core principle. Encoding decisions, normalisation criteria, and the scope of annotation are
              documented and made visible, allowing the edition to be read not only as a textual resource but also as a methodological artefact.
              The limits of the edition—what it does not attempt to do—are therefore part of its scholarly argument.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project also incorporates assisted translation as a support mechanism for access and exploration. Translations are explicitly
              identified as non-authoritative reading aids rather than scholarly substitutes for the source texts. Their function is to reduce
              linguistic barriers, while interpretive responsibility remains anchored in the encoded documents and their contextual metadata.
            </p>

            <p>
              A key component of the project’s interpretive strategy lies in standoff annotations and external authority files. Relationships among
              persons, places, institutions, and documents are modelled as structured assertions linked to specific textual evidence. These modelling
              choices constitute a form of controlled interpretation: they make historical relations explicit, while remaining separable from the
              transcription itself. In doing so, <em>Varela Digital</em> acknowledges that data modelling is never neutral, but seeks to make
              interpretation explicit, traceable, and revisable.

            <h2>From texts to structured data</h2>

            <p>
              <em>Varela Digital</em> is built as a layered environment in which the same corpus is represented through complementary formats,
              each designed to support a different set of scholarly and user-facing needs. Rather than treating the documents only as pages to
              read, the project treats them as structured sources that can be navigated and analysed across the corpus.
            </p>

            <h3>1. TEI/XML as the textual and editorial layer</h3>
            <p>
              TEI/XML is the project’s primary editorial format. It preserves the internal structure of each document (e.g., headings, openings and
              closings, endorsements, editorial notes, and named entities) and records explicit encoding decisions. TEI is therefore not only a publishing
              format, but the authoritative representation from which other outputs are derived.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Metadata as an operational layer for navigation</h3>
            <p>
              A structured metadata table (CSV) supports browsing across the corpus, enabling indexes and filters by document identifier, sender, recipient,
              date, and places of sending and reception. This layer serves users who approach the collection through document-level access points rather than
              full-text reading, and it also provides a practical bridge between the textual encoding and the knowledge graph.
            </p>

            <h3>3. XSLT to pre-generated HTML</h3>
            <p>
              For web publication, the project adopts XSLT transformations that generate static HTML pages in advance. This choice ensures stable rendering,
              fast loading times, and maintainability in a GitHub Pages deployment. Pre-generated HTML also makes the edition resilient: the reading interface
              does not depend on a server-side application, while still supporting interactive features in the browser.
            </p>

            <h3>4. RDF/JSON-LD as the semantic layer</h3>
            <p>
              In parallel to the textual edition, the project produces a semantic representation of the corpus in RDF, serialised as JSON-LD. This layer
              models documents, persons, places, organisations, and events as identifiable nodes connected through explicit relations, including the domain-specific
              predicates defined in HRAO. Even without a public SPARQL endpoint in this phase, publishing RDF/JSON-LD supports interoperability, reuse, and future
              integration with other datasets and research infrastructures.
            </p>

            <p>
              Taken together, these layers define the project’s knowledge base: a corpus that can be read as edited text, explored through metadata-driven indexes,
              and analysed as a graph of entities and relations.

            <h2>Reuse and interoperability</h2>

            <p>
              A central design principle of <em>Varela Digital</em> is interoperability. From the outset, the project was conceived not as an isolated digital edition,
              but as a resource capable of connecting with other datasets, tools, and research initiatives within the broader digital humanities and cultural heritage
              ecosystem.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Reused vocabularies and shared standards</h3>
            <p>
              Wherever possible, the project reuses established vocabularies and conceptual frameworks, including Dublin Core for basic descriptive metadata, FOAF for
              modelling persons and social relations, and bibliographic concepts inspired by FRBR and FaBiO. This strategy avoids unnecessary reinvention and ensures
              that the data produced can be more easily understood, aligned, and reused beyond the scope of this project.
            </p>

            <h3>2. HRAO as a minimal domain-specific extension</h3>
            <p>
              The Historical Relations of Archival Objects (HRAO) ontology was developed as a deliberately minimal and focused extension, introducing only those properties
              necessary to express historically meaningful relations emerging from the corpus. Rather than competing with existing ontologies, HRAO complements them by
              capturing forms of agency, responsibility, and interaction that are specific to nineteenth-century correspondence and archival documents.

            <h3>3. Why reuse matters</h3>
            <p>
              By combining reused vocabularies with a small set of domain-specific properties, <em>Varela Digital</em> establishes a data model that is both expressive and
              sustainable. This approach supports linking with external datasets, strengthens the project’s visualisation pipeline, and makes the outputs easier to reuse
              in other historical and digital contexts.

            <h2>Current state and roadmap</h2>

            <p>
              <em>Varela Digital</em> is conceived as an evolving research environment, and its current state reflects a functional pilot implementation rather than a
              speculative prototype. The platform already supports both close reading and structured exploration of the corpus.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Current implementation</h3>
            <p>
              The current version includes a complete editorial workflow from TEI/XML to static HTML publication, a document viewer with integrated annotations, and
              metadata-driven indexes that enable access to the corpus by document identifier, sender, recipient, date, and place. The encoding of named entities and
              relations supports cross-document navigation and provides the basis for semantic analysis.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Ongoing developments</h3>
            <p>
              Building on this foundation, the project is implementing spatial visualisations that map the circulation of correspondence, as well as network visualisations
              that represent relationships between persons and institutions. In parallel, RDF and JSON-LD exports are being consolidated to reflect the project’s full
              semantic model.
            </p>

            <p>
              Together, these components define <em>Varela Digital</em> as a knowledge-oriented edition: a platform in which historical texts, editorial interpretation,
              and structured data converge to support both human inquiry and computational analysis.
