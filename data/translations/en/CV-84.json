  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nI must inform Your Excellency, the Most Illustrious Sir José André, that the 1st Sergeant João Marques and the Quartermaster Luís Carlos have seduced more than thirty soldiers, and it is impossible to rely on such men for any service other than near their homes, causing enormous expense to the Nation! I protest against this band of anarchists who must be so called, especially against these inferiors, the instigators of this latest desertion, hoping in Your Excellency, Most Illustrious Sir Ta- , and I also doubt that this officer will arrive with men at that point. I am still lacking some officers whom I sent to the rear to gather some troops, as well as an ensign whom I sent to Torres to march with the police of that place, and I hope that before I reach Caí these will join me.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.  \nCamp on the march near Aldeia dos Anjos, December 21, 1842.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Francisco Antônio da Silva Bitancourt, Colonel and Adjutant-General.  \nJoão Pedro de Abreu.  \nInterim Commanding Major.\n\nRespond in accordance with the order of the day in this matter."
