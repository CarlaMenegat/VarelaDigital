  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nI must inform Your Excellency, the Most Illustrious Sir José André, that First Sergeant João Marques and Furriel Luís Carlos, seducing more than thirty soldiers, and it is not possible to rely on such men for any service other than near their homes, causing enormous expense to the Nation! I protest against this group of anarchists who should be called as such, especially against these subordinates, the instigators of this last desertion, relying on Your Excellency, Most Illustrious Sir Ta-, and I also doubt that this officer will arrive with men at that point. I am still lacking some officers whom I sent to the rear to gather some troops, as well as a second lieutenant whom I sent to the Torres to march with the police of that place, and I hope that before I reach Caí, these will have joined me.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency.  \nCamp in march near Aldeia dos Anjos, December 21, 1842.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Francisco Antônio da Silva Bitancourt, Colonel and Assistant General.  \nJoão Pedro de Abreu, Interim Commanding Major.\n\nRespond in accordance with the order of the day on the matter."
