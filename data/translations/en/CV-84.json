  "translation": "I must inform Your Excellency, Mr. José André, 1st Sergeant João Marques, and Quartermaster Luís Carlos, that more than thirty soldiers have deserted, and it is not possible to count on such people for any service other than close to their homes, incurring enormous expenses for the Nation! I protest against this group of anarchists that must be called as such, especially against these lower ranks, the instigators of this latest desertion, hoping in Your Excellency that—, and I also doubt that this officer will arrive with men at that point. I still lack some officers whom I sent to the rear to gather some troops, as well as a sub-lieutenant whom I sent to the Towers to march with the local police, and I hope that before I reach the Caí, I will have these men gathered."
