  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nI must inform Your Most Excellent Lordship José André, the 1st Sergeant João Marques and the Furriel Luís Carlos, seducing more than thirty soldiers, and it is not possible to rely on such men for any service other than near their homes, causing great expense to the Nation! I protest against this group of anarchists, who must be so called, especially against these inferiors, the instigators of this last desertion, relying on Your Most Excellent Lordship and I also doubt that this officer will bring men to that point. I am still missing some officers whom I sent to the rear to gather some troops, as well as an ensign whom I sent to the Torres to march with the police of that place, and I hope that before I arrive at Caí these will join me.\n\nGod preserve Your Lordship.  \nCamp on the march near Aldeia dos Anjos, December 21, 1842.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Francisco Antônio da Silva Bitancourt, Colonel and Adjutant-General.  \nJoão Pedro de Abreu.  \nInterim Commanding Major.\n\nReply in the sense of the day's order concerning this matter."
