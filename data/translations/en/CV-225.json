  "translation": "We are on September 12 Dear Bernardina\n\nAfter having written to you, I remembered to tell you that our vicar general asks me for a slave to serve him, as he has none, and if you can spare José for this purpose I would appreciate it. About the slaves from Montevideo, if Ramirez does any trickery, I will collect from what the State owes him: therefore I am not worried about what Belém says.\n\nOur schooners captured the sloop “Mineira” at the Lagoa dos Patos, very important.\n\nHugs to all and you receive the heart of yours, Almeida.\n\nLady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida."
