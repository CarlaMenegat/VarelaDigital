  "translation": "We are on September 12th Dear Bernardina\n\nAfter having written to you, I remembered to tell you that our vicar general is asking me for a slave to serve him, as he has none, and if you can spare José for this purpose, I would appreciate it. Regarding the slaves from Montevideo, if Ramirez tries any trickery, I will claim from him what the State owes him: therefore, what Belém says does not concern me.\n\nOur barges captured the sloop “Mineira” in the Lagoa dos Patos, very important.\n\nHugs to all and receive the heart of yours, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida."
