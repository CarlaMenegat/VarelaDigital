  "translation": "After having written to you, I remembered to tell you that our vicar general is asking me for a servant to serve him, as he has none, and if you could spare José for that purpose, I would appreciate it. Regarding the slaves from Montevideo, if Ramirez does anything foolish, I will hold him accountable for what the State owes him: therefore, I am not concerned with what Belém says.\n\nOur lanchões captured the “Mineira” off the Lagoa dos Patos, which is very important."
