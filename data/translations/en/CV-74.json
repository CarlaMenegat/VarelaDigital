  "translation": "I am sending to Your Excellency Lieutenant José Alves de Medeiros, interim commander of the Squadron of Triumph, the news of the death of the assassin Farias, which greatly benefits humanity with the demise of such a wicked person; yesterday I was informed that he had come down to the Triumph crossing with a villain; at night I sent a party to ambush on his retreat path, not only to capture him but also to catch some deserters from the corps. This party has not yet returned.\n\nThat is all I have to bring to Your Excellency’s attention.\n\nSeen by His Excellency December 28, 1842.\n\nOrder of the day No. 12 of the 31st of the said.\n\nFor the order of the day, the case of the death of Farias."
