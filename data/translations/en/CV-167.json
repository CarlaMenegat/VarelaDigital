  "translation": "Bagé, December 19, 1842. My dear husband.\n\nAlthough I wrote to you yesterday, finding great satisfaction when I write to you, hence I write again; I am quite glad that you are not making your trip to Uruguay, for it was the knot I had in my throat to acknowledge that it was such a dangerous journey.\n\nThe mulatta Merenciana is at home again; while she stayed at Augusto’s house, Augusto sent word to uncle José; he wrote a letter to Augusto ordering him to fetch her; I told Augusto to speak with Joaquim Pedro, and he replied to Augusto that he did not yet have the authority to turn her over, as long as she had not been presented; in light of these matters I showed the justice of the peace so that he would take charge of her, for you see well that we cannot, as our family is very large; he has yet to take steps to remove her from the house.\n\nJoaquim Pereira is going to take up the job again; with Fontoura’s departure I recommend that you take every care of yourself because of intrigues, avoid them as much as you can; send many regards to Bernardino, Father Hildebrando, Prudêncio; all the children send their regards and ask for your blessing.\n\nPelópidas is very alert, already speaking, soon he will be walking; your Abrilina more and more of a poet.\n\nFrom your wife who esteems you greatly, Bernardina Almeida.\n\nAnswered December 28, 1842.\n\nHonorable Senhor Domingos José de Almeida. Alegrete."
