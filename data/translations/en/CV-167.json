  "translation": "Although I wrote to you yesterday, finding great satisfaction in writing to you, that is why I am doing this; I am quite happy that you are not making your trip to Uruguay, as it was a knot in my throat to acknowledge that it was such a dangerous journey.\n\nThe mulatto Merenciana is back home; while she was at Augusto's house, Augusto sent word to Uncle José; he wrote a letter to Augusto asking him to bring her back; I told Augusto to speak with Joaquim Pedro, and he replied to Augusto that he still did not have the order to hand her over, while he had not presented her; because of these reasons, I made it clear to the justice of the peace to take care of her, as you can see that we cannot, because our family is very large; until now, he has not taken action to remove her from the house.\n\nJoaquim Pereira will take the job again; with Fontoura's departure, I recommend that you be very cautious because of the intrigues, avoid them as much as you can; send many greetings to Bernardino, Father Hildebrando, Prudêncio; all the boys send their regards and ask for your blessing.\n\nPelópidas is very alert now, he is already starting to talk, he won't be long in walking; your Abrilina is becoming more of a poet every day."
