  "translation": "Bagé, December 19, 1842. My dear husband.\n\nAlthough I wrote to you yesterday, finding great satisfaction when I write to you, that is why I am doing so again; I am quite glad that you are not making your trip to Uruguay, for it was a knot in my throat to acknowledge that it was such a dangerous journey.\n\nThe mulatta Merenciana is once again at home; while she was at Augusto’s house, Augusto sent to say to uncle José; he wrote a letter to Augusto ordering him to fetch her; I told Augusto to speak with Joaquim Pedro and he replied to Augusto that he did not yet have orders to hand her over, as long as she had not shown up; in light of these things I made the justice of the peace see that he should take care of her, for you see well that we cannot, because our family is very large; so far he has taken no steps to remove her from the house.\n\nJoaquim Pereira is going to take the job again; with Fontoura’s departure I recommend that you take every care with yourself on account of intrigues, avoid them as much as you can; give many regards to Bernardino, Father Hildebrando, Prudêncio; all the children send their regards and ask for your blessing.\n\nPelópidas is very lively, already talking, he will soon be walking; your Abrilina increasingly a poet.\n\nFrom your wife who esteems you greatly, Bernardina Almeida.\n\nAnswered on December 28, 1842.\n\nIllustrious Sir Domingos José de Almeida. Alegrete."
