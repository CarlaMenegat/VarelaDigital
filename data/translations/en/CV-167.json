  "translation": "Bagé, December 19, 1842. My dear husband.\n\nAlthough I wrote to you yesterday, finding great satisfaction in writing to you, that is why I do it again; I am quite glad that you are not making your trip to Uruguay, for it was the knot in my throat to acknowledge that it was such a dangerous journey.\n\nThe mulatto Merenciana is at home again; while she was at Augusto's house, Augusto sent word to Uncle José; he wrote a letter to Augusto ordering him to fetch her; I told Augusto to speak with Joaquim Pedro and he replied to Augusto that he did not yet have orders to deliver her, as long as he had not presented himself; because of these matters I made the justice of the peace aware to take charge of her, since you see well that we cannot, because our family is very large; so far he has not taken any measures to remove her from the house.\n\nJoaquim Pereira will resume the job; with Fontoura's departure I recommend that you take all care for yourself because of the intrigues, avoid them as much as you can; give many regards to Bernardino, Father Hildebrando, Prudêncio; all the children send their regards and ask for your blessing.\n\nPelópidas is very clever, he is already speaking, he will soon walk; your Abrilina more and more a poet.\n\nFrom your wife who esteems you greatly, Bernardina Almeida.\n\nAnswered on December 28, 1842.\n\nMost illustrious Senhor Domingos José de Almeida. Alegrete."
