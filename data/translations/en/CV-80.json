  "translation": "Some officers from the battalion under your command will go to collect your luggage and that of the other officers, which Your Excellency must, without fail, have sent to this point; the ranks of the 1st Battalion should arrive at this place tomorrow or the day after, and as soon as they arrive, I will have them march along with 50 more cavalry men to that city; nothing has occurred here that I need to inform you of, except that the devastation of Canabarro is certainly growing worse and that he himself was taken prisoner and badly wounded; if that is the case, we may consider the war over."
