  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nSome officers from the battalion under your command will go to fetch your luggage and that of the other officers, which Your Lordship must, without fail, send directly to this point; the privates of the 1st Battalion should arrive at this place tomorrow or the day after, and as soon as they arrive I will make them march with 50 more cavalrymen to that city; nothing has occurred here worthy of reporting to you, other than the increasingly certain defeat of Canabarro, and that he himself was taken prisoner and very wounded; if this is so, we have the war ended.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship. Campo near Canguçu, July 1, 1844.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Luís José Ferreira  \nLieutenant Colonel Commanding the Garrison of the city of Pelotas  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu"
