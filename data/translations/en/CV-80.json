  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nSome officers from the battalion under your command will go to fetch your baggage and that of the other officers, which Your Lordship must, without fail, send to this location; the soldiers of the 1st Battalion should arrive at this place tomorrow or the day after, and as soon as they arrive I will march them with another 50 cavalrymen to that city; nothing has happened here worth reporting to you, except that the destruction of Canabarro is certainly intensifying and that he himself was taken prisoner and seriously wounded; if this is so, we are with the war ended.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nField near Canguçu, July 1, 1844.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Luís José Ferreira  \nLieutenant-Colonel Commander of the Garrison of the city of Pelotas.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu"
