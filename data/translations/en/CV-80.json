  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nSome officers from the battalion of your command will go to fetch your luggage and that of the other officers, which Your Lordship must, without fail, send to this point; the enlisted men of the 1st Battalion should arrive at this place tomorrow or the day after, and as soon as they arrive I will make them march with 50 more cavalrymen to that city; nothing has occurred here to inform you of, except that the defeat of Canabarro is increasingly certain, and that he himself was a prisoner and severely wounded; if this is so, we can consider the war over.\n\nGod preserve Your Lordship  \nCamp near Canguçu, July 1, 1844.  \n\nMost Illustrious Sir Luís José Ferreira,  \nLieutenant-Colonel Commander of the Garrison of the city of Pelotas.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu"
