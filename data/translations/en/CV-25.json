  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nEntrusted by Your Excellency Domingos José de Almeida, formerly Quartermaster-General and Minister of Finance, supposing they deserve all my trust; however, in fulfillment of my duty, I cannot agree, given the lack of solemnity with which they should be invested, since their validity rests on the authenticity of the documents, which is not found, because they mention amounts expended on behalf of the State, which, not being documented, cannot be credited to it, these amounts indicated on page 2 totaling Rs. 446$560. And in the same manner, and under the same circumstances, I consider the addition found on page 10, which certifies the shipment of 207 horses sent to the army by Gaspar Borges; for of the 84 documents attached to the accounts presented, there is no proof of delivery to this Borges, nor from him to the army. The amounts shown in the account on page 7, with the exception of the amount given to Colonel Onofre and José Carlos Pinto, as he was appointed Agent of the State, the rest cannot be credited, nor even recognized as debts of the State, because some lack documentation, and for others, the presented ones, I do not consider sufficient to merit the credit claimed, and even the debt of Jaime Legris, to be given attention, was necessary.\n\nIn view of the above, it seems to me that I have sufficiently demonstrated my opinion, judging therefore that deducted the amount of Rs. 446$560 as well as Rs. 4:422$874 on page 7, and presenting the document of delivery of the 207 horses, the amount of Rs. 5:658$651 should be satisfied, an amount that I consider liquid, and as such, under the circumstances, to be paid, considering it legally expended.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency, November 20, 1837.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Afonso José de Almeida Corte Real, Minister and Secretary of Finance Affairs.  \nAntônio José de Abreu  \nPublic Prosecutor.\n\nResponse of Antônio José de Abreu when Public Prosecutor."
