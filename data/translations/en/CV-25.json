  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nEntrusted by Your Excellency Domingos José de Almeida, formerly Quartermaster-General and Minister of Finance, I suppose they deserve all my trust; however, in fulfillment of my duty, I cannot comply, given the lack of solemnity with which they must be endowed, since their validity lies in the authenticity of the documents, which is lacking, because they mention amounts spent in favor of the State, which, not being documented, cannot be credited to it; these amounts indicated on page 2 total the sum of Rs. 446$560. In the same manner, and under similar circumstances, I consider the addition found on page 10, in which the shipment of 207 horses led to the army by Gaspar Borges is confirmed; for of the 84 documents attached to the accounts presented, no delivery to this Borges, nor from him to the army, is realized. The amounts shown in the account on page 7, with the exception of the sum given to Colonel Onofre and José Carlos Pinto, since the latter is constituted Agent of the State, the others cannot be credited nor even recognized as debts of the State, because some lack documentation, and others, whose documents are presented, I do not judge sufficient to deserve the credit intended, and even the debt of Jaime Legris, to be given attention, would require\n\nIn view of the foregoing, it seems to me that I have sufficiently demonstrated my opinion, judging therefore, that after deducting the sum of Rs. 446$560, as well as that of Rs. 4:422$874 from page 7, and upon presentation of the document of delivery of the 207 horses, the sum of Rs. 5:658$651 should be satisfied to you, a sum which I consider liquid, and as such under the circumstances it should be paid, since it is considered legally expended.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency. November 20, 1837.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Afonso José de Almeida Corte Real, Minister and Secretary of the Affairs of the Treasury.\n\nAntônio José de Abreu Fiscal Procurator.\n\nResponse of Antônio José de Abreu when Fiscal Procurator."
