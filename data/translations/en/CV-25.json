  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nEntrusted by Your Excellency Domingos José de Almeida, formerly Quartermaster-General and Minister of the Treasury, I suppose they deserve all my credit; however, in fulfillment of my duty, I cannot agree, considering the lack of solemnity with which they should be adorned, since their validity lies in the authenticity of the documents, which is not found, because they mention disbursed amounts in favor of the State, which, not being documented, cannot be credited to it, the amounts indicated on page 2 totaling the sum of Rs. 446$560. \n\nAnd in the same manner, and under the same circumstances, I consider the addition found on page 10, which certifies the shipment of 207 horses delivered to the army by Gaspar Borges; for out of 84 documents attached to the presented accounts, neither the delivery to that Borges nor from him to the army is realized. \n\nThe amounts shown in the account on page 7, except the amount given to Colonel Onofre and José Carlos Pinto, as he is constituted Agent of the State, the others cannot be credited nor even recognized as debts of the State, because some have no documents, and others whose documents are presented, I do not consider sufficient to warrant the credit claimed, and even the debt of Jaime Legris to be considered would be necessary.\n\nIn view, therefore, of the above, it seems to me I have sufficiently demonstrated my opinion, judging, therefore, that by deducting the sum of Rs. 446$560 as well as Rs. 4:422$874 from page 7, and presenting the document of delivery of the 207 horses, the amount of Rs. 5:658$651 should be satisfied, an amount I consider clear, and as such under the circumstances should be satisfied, considering it legally disbursed.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency.  \nNovember 20, 1837.  \n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Afonso José de Almeida Corte Real, Minister and Secretary of the Treasury Affairs.  \nAntônio José de Abreu  \nFiscal Prosecutor.\n\nResponse of Antônio José de Abreu as Fiscal Prosecutor."
