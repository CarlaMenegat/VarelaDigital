  "translation": "Charged by Your Excellency Domingos José de Almeida, former Quartermaster General and Minister of Finance, I suppose they deserve all the credit; however, in compliance with my duty, I cannot conform, given the lack of solemnity that they must be adorned with, since their validity exists in the authenticity of the documents, which is what is not found, because they mention amounts disbursed in favor of the State, which, not being documented, cannot be credited to it. The amounts indicated on page 2 total Rs. 446$560. Similarly, and under the same circumstances, I consider the addition found on page 10, which certifies the shipment of 207 horses transported to the army by Gaspar Borges; for of the 84 documents that are attached to the accounts presented, there is no delivery to Borges, nor from him to the army. The amounts demonstrated in the account on page 7, except for the sum given to Colonel Onofre and José Carlos Pinto, since he is constituted as the Agent of the State, the others cannot be credited, nor even recognized as debts of the State, because some lack documentation, and the others, as presented, I do not find sufficient to deserve the credit sought; and even the debt of Jaime Legris requires attention, which was necessary.\n\nIn view of the above, it seems to me I have sufficiently demonstrated my opinion, believing therefore that subtracting the amounts of 446$560 rs. as well as 4:422$874 rs. from page 7, and presenting the document for the delivery of the 207 horses, he should be satisfied with the amount of Rs. 5:658$651, an amount I consider net, and as such under the circumstances to be satisfied, since I consider it legally disbursed.\n\nResponse from Antônio José de Abreu when Fiscal Prosecutor."
