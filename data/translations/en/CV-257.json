  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir  \nPiratini, October 5, 1838.\n\nThe ease of exportation to the neighboring State and the absence of local authorities from their respective districts due to the movements of the war have allowed unscrupulous men and vagabonds to make great cattle slaughterings with interest only in the hides; and such conduct affecting public morals and national wealth, the government has resolved to take the measure found in the enclosed circular, which for its due effect Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Serafim dos Anjos França, General Inspector of the Treasury.\n\nIt is approved. In the absence of the chief officer. The Clerk Antônio Francisco dos Reis.\n\nIt is approved. Your Excellency."
