  "translation": "My beloved husband, January 13, 1836.\n\nEvery day we receive new news here, I do not know if all true, but for me troubling; I have this good opportunity, I will inform you of the latest that came to me yesterday by the Leão Próspero, namely: that the President will not come there to take office, but here, this or next week, and that as soon as he takes office, our creditors are intent on coming to take possession of all that is ours, which if it happens, we will suffer great loss; if from this it is possible to take any measure, I will be happier than if you appeared here at this moment, because those gentlemen Batista Fernandes.\n\nThere is already a large subscription for the celebrations after the President’s inauguration; nonetheless, as I consider all these matters uncertain, some suspicion remains, and I will give time to time, and I will keep informing you of whatever happens.\n\nThe proclamation of Senhor Bento Gonçalves was not read in front of the National Guards; Antunes was very upset that it was not sent to him, as captain, and the other, perhaps out of fear, did not publish it; this is how everything is going around here; more in the other letter which I write to you at this time, you will know etc.\n\nYour very loving Bernardina\n\nAccept regards from José F. who received yesterday the proclamation you sent him.\n\nSenhor Domingos José de Almeida — Porto Alegre."
