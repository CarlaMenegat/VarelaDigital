  "translation": "My beloved husband, January 13, 1836.\n\nEvery day we have new news here, I do not know if all true, but for me disturbing; I have this good opportunity to inform you of the latest that came to me yesterday by the Leão Próspero, namely: that the President will not take office there, but here, this week or the next, and that as soon as he takes office, our creditors with formed claims will come to take control of all that is ours, which if it happens, we will suffer great loss; if any measure can be taken from this, I would be more content than at this time seeing you appear here, because of those gentlemen Batista Fernandes.\n\nThere is already a large subscription for festivities after the President’s inauguration; however, as I consider all these matters troubled, I remain somewhat distrustful, and I will give time to time, and will keep warning you of whatever happens.\n\nThe proclamation of Senhor Bento Gonçalves was not read in front of the National Guards; Antunes was very scandalized that it was not sent to him, as captain, and the other, perhaps out of fear, did not publish it; here is how everything goes around here; the rest another time, which I write to you on this occasion, you will know, etc.\n\nYour very loving Bernardina\n\nAccept regards from José F. who received yesterday the proclamation you sent him.\n\nSenhor Domingos José de Almeida — Porto Alegre."
