  "translation": "Every day we receive new news here, I don't know if all of it is true, but for me it's troubling; I have this good opportunity, I will share with you the latest that came to me yesterday through Leão Próspero, namely: that the President will not take office there, but rather here, this week or next, and as soon as he assumes, our creditors are determined to come and take control of everything that is ours, which, if it happens, will cause us great loss; if something can be done about it, I would be happier than if you appear here on this occasion, because those gentlemen Batista Fernandes.\n\nThere is already a large subscription for the celebrations after the President's inauguration; however, as I consider all these matters quite suspect, I remain somewhat distrustful, and I will give time to time, and I will keep you informed of any developments.\n\nThe proclamation of Senhor Bento Gonçalves was not read in front of the National Guards; Antunes was very scandalized that it was not sent to him, as captain, and the other one, perhaps out of fear, did not publish it; here is how everything stands here; you will know more in the next letter, which I am writing to you on this occasion, etc."
