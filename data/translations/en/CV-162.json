  "translation": "My dear husband, January 13, 1836.\n\nEvery day we have new news here; I do not know if all is true, but it is troubling to me; I have this good opportunity to inform you of the latest that came to me yesterday via Leão Próspero, namely: that the President will not take office there, but here, this or the following week, and that as soon as he takes office, our creditors, with title in hand, will come to take control of all that is ours, and if that happens, we will suffer great loss; if any measures can be taken from there, I would be more content than for you to appear here at this time, because those gentlemen Batista Fernandes.\n\nThere is already a large subscription for the festivities after the President’s inauguration; however, as I consider all these matters to be precarious, I remain somewhat suspicious, and I am giving time to time, and will keep you informed of whatever happens.\n\nThe proclamation of Senhor Bento Gonçalves was not read in front of the National Guards; Antunes was very upset for not having been sent it as captain, and the other, perhaps out of fear, did not publish it; this is how everything is going here; more in the next letter, which I write to you at this time, you will know etc.\n\nYour very loving Bernardina\n\nAccept regards from José F. who received yesterday the proclamation that you sent him.\n\nSenhor Domingos José de Almeida — Porto Alegre."
