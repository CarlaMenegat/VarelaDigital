  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nIn accordance with the orders of Your Excellency, the 5th Corps of my command and the 12th of the 3rd Corps, with the cavalry officers, Captain Belisário, Captain Rafael Viana, Lieutenant Isaías, Lieutenant Marcos, and Lieutenant of the extinct 2nd Line Antônio Pedro de Abreu, Ensign Júlio Viana, Ensign Ferreira, Ensign Cruz, Ensign Machado; and ascending the river all embarked on the war barges and pinnaces at midnight, I disembarked on the left side at Santa Cruz; and continuing by night through the thickets above the arroio dos Ratos, I lay in ambush in front of the pottery of the late Juca Leão until dawn on the 22nd, when I opened a new path through which I passed, leaving there at 9 o’clock, heading straight to the crossing of the parish of Triunfo, capturing some horses and suspicious persons, and from there I marched all night, reaching dawn at the Roque hill on the 23rd.\n\nAhead of said hill, I found a group of rebels, about 40 to 50 men, commanded by the self-styled Lieutenant-Colonel Silveira, from Encruzilhada, whom, despite the horses being somewhat burdened, I attacked, leading the front with Lieutenant Isaías and Ensign Júlio commanding the guerrilla, and Captain Rafael Viana, Ensign Cruz, and I commanding the protection with the rest following; and said group was completely crushed, with four men killed on the field and five prisoners taken, and it is likely that many were wounded; leaving us some horses saddled with ordinary tack; the rest were pursued more than two leagues, up to the entrance of the hills of Erval; and on that same day at 6 in the afternoon, I directed myself to the entrance of the path of the general mountain of Erval, which, due to its extent and rough paths, I crossed at great difficulty in two nights and one day and emerged at São João at daybreak on the 25th.\n\nAnd restoring some horses there, I sent Lieutenant Antônio Pedro de Abreu out with 60 men down the Duro pass, to the arroio Velhaco, down Camaquã, recruiting the horses that appeared and making junction on the 26th at Butta, with said Lieutenant Abreu, who was there, according to orders, with over a hundred tame horses; from there at night I began to withdraw directly to the chapel of Dores, and from there to the pass of Araçá, where I arrived on the 28th at 4 in the morning, waiting for daybreak to open a path; and passing through it at 6 o’clock of that day, I received news of a rebel group waiting for me, and, while changing horses, I sent out Lieutenant Antônio Pedro de Abreu with 6 men as scouts, who, encountering the enemy’s advance guard of 6 men, commanded by the Police Commander Ricardo, a wary, wicked rebel, swiftly attacked, capturing five and killing one; which, observed by the other enemies, they quickly withdrew, giving no chance to my men to operate; and so I continued toward making junction with Your Excellency Ricardo and another similar, son of Bento Surdo, and Jacinto Roque, justice of the peace of the rebels at Roque hill, and six presented.\n\nThere was no breach in the forces of legality, except for one of the 5th Corps who deserted. Having thus fulfilled my measures and complied with the orders of Your Excellency, Sir Dom Pedro Segundo.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nHeadquarters in Porto Alegre, December 31, 1839.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Filipe Neri de Oliveira, Brigadier Commander of the 2nd Brigade.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel Commander of the 5th Corps of the National Guard."
