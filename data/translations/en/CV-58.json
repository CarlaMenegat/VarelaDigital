  "translation": "According to the orders of Your Excellency, the 5th Corps under my command and 12 from the 3rd Corps with the cavalry officers, Captain Belisário, Captain Rafael Viana, Lieutenant Isaías, Lieutenant Marcos, and Lieutenant of the extinct 2nd Line Antônio Pedro de Abreu, Second Lieutenant Júlio Viana, Second Lieutenant Ferreira, Second Lieutenant Cruz, Second Lieutenant Machado; and proceeding upstream at midnight, I debarked from the left side in Santa Cruz; and continuing that night through the woods of the Arroio dos Ratos, I ambushed in front of the pottery of the late Juca Leão until dawn on the 22nd, on which day I opened a new path where I passed, leaving there at 9 o'clock that day, directly to the crossing of the parish of Triunfo, capturing some horses and suspicious individuals, and from there I marched all night, arriving at the Cerro do Roque on the 23rd.\n\nIn front of the mentioned hill, I encountered a group of rebels, of 40 to 50 men, commanded by the self-proclaimed Lieutenant Colonel Silveira, from Encruzilhada, who, despite the horses being somewhat heavy, I attacked, sending Lieutenant Isaías and Second Lieutenant Júlio to command the guerrilla at the front, while Captain Rafael Viana, Second Lieutenant Cruz, and I followed with the rest of the men; and said group was completely destroyed, leaving four men dead on the field and five prisoners, and it is likely that many were wounded; leaving us some saddled horses with ordinary gear; the rest was pursued for more than two leagues, until the entrance of the hills of Erval; and that same day at 6 o'clock in the evening, I headed towards the entrance of the path of the general Serra do Erval, which due to its extent and steep paths I managed to cross at considerable cost in two nights and one day, exiting in São João on the morning of the 25th.\n\nAnd recovering some horses there, I sent Lieutenant Antônio Pedro de Abreu with 60 men down the Duro passage, until the Arroio Velhaco, downstream of Camaquã, recruiting the mounted troops that appeared and joining on the 26th at Butta, with the aforementioned Lieutenant Abreu, who, according to orders, was there with a hundred and so tame horses; from where at night I began to withdraw directly to the Chapel of Dores, and from there to the passage of Araçá, where I arrived on the 28th at 4 o'clock in the morning, where I waited for dawn to open a path; and passing through it at 6 o'clock that day, I received news of a rebel party waiting for me, and while changing horses, I sent Lieutenant Antônio Pedro de Abreu with 6 men ahead, who, encountering the enemy's picket of 6 men, commanded by Police Commander Ricardo, a cunning, treacherous rebel, quickly attacked, capturing five and killing one; which observed by the other enemies, they quickly retreated, not allowing my men to engage; and thus I proceeded to join with Your Excellency Ricardo and another similar one, son of Bento Surdo, and Jacinto Roque, peace judge of the rebels at the Cerro do Roque, and six presented.\n\nThere was no break in the forces of legality, except for one from the 5th Corps who deserted. Thus, my measures were fulfilled, and the orders of Your Excellency, Lord Dom Pedro II, were complied with."
