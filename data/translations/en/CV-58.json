  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn accordance with Your Excellency's orders, the 5th Corps of my command and the 12th of the 3rd Corps, with the cavalry officers, Captain Belisário, Captain Rafael Viana, Lieutenant Isaías, Lieutenant Marcos, and Lieutenant of the extinct 2nd Line Antônio Pedro de Abreu, Ensign Júlio Viana, Ensign Ferreira, Ensign Cruz, Ensign Machado; and all proceeding upriver, embarked on war barges and launches, at midnight I disembarked, on the left side, at Santa Cruz; and continuing during the night through the thickets along the arroio dos Ratos upriver, I ambushed in front of the kiln of the late Juca Leão, until dawn on the 22nd, when I opened a new path through which I passed, leaving there at 9 o’clock that day, straight to the crossing of the parish of Triunfo, capturing some horses and suspicious persons, and from there I marched all night, arriving at dawn on the 23rd at the Roque hill.\n\nAhead of said hill, I found a detachment of rebels, numbering from 40 to 50 men, commanded by the self-styled Lieutenant-Colonel Silveira, of Encruzilhada; who, although the horses were somewhat tired, I attacked, sending Lieutenant Isaías and Ensign Júlio in front commanding the guerrilla, and Captain Rafael Viana, together with Ensign Cruz and myself with the main force following for protection; and this detachment was completely destroyed, with four men left dead on the field and five prisoners, and it is believed that many were wounded; leaving us some horses with ordinary tack; the remainder was pursued for more than two leagues, up to the entrance of the Erval hills; and on the same day at 6 o’clock in the afternoon, I directed myself to the entrance of the path of the Erval general mountain range, which, due to its extent and rugged paths, I crossed with great difficulty in two nights and one day, emerging in São João at dawn on the 25th.\n\nAnd replenishing myself there of some horses, I sent Lieutenant Antônio Pedro de Abreu out with 60 men down the Duro crossing, to the Velhaco arroio, downstream Camaquã, recruiting horses that appeared and making junction on the 26th at Butta with said Lieutenant Abreu, who there, according to orders, was with one hundred and some gentle horses; from where at night I began to withdraw directly to the chapel of Dores, and from there to the crossing of Araçá, where I arrived on the 28th at 4 a.m., where I waited for the daylight to open a path; and passing through it at 6 o’clock that day, I received news of a rebel detachment waiting for me and, while changing horses, I sent out Lieutenant Antônio Pedro de Abreu with 6 men on reconnaissance, who, encountering the enemy’s reconnaissance group of 6 men commanded by Police Commander Ricardo, a resentful, vicious rebel, quickly attacked, capturing five and killing one; this observed by other enemy forces, who swiftly withdrew, not giving my men an opportunity to engage; and thus I proceeded to make junction with Your Excellency Ricardo and another like him, son of Bento Surdo, and Jacinto Roque, the rebels’ justice of the peace at Roque hill, and six presented.\n\nThere was no break in the forces of legality, except for one from the 5th Corps who deserted. Thus, my measures were fulfilled, and the orders of Your Excellency, Sir Dom Pedro Segundo, were accomplished.\n\nGod bless Your Excellency.  \nHeadquarters in Porto Alegre, December 31, 1839.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Filipe Neri de Oliveira, Brigadier Commander of the 2nd Brigade.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel Commander of the 5th Corps of the National Guard."
