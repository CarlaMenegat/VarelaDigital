  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Exalted Sir,\n\nIn accordance with the orders of Your Excellency, the 5th Corps of my command and the 12th of the 3rd Corps, with the cavalry officers, Captain Belisário, Captain Rafael Viana, Lieutenant Isaías, Lieutenant Marcos, and Lieutenant Antônio Pedro de Abreu of the extinct 2nd Line, Ensign Júlio Viana, Ensign Ferreira, Ensign Cruz, Ensign Machado; and following all upriver aboard the war barges and lighters at midnight, I disembarked, on the left side, at Santa Cruz; and continuing by night through the woods up Arroio dos Ratos, I ambushed in front of the pottery of the late Juca Leão, until the dawn of the 22nd, when I opened a new path through which I passed, leaving at 9 o’clock that day, directly to the pass of the parish of Triunfo, capturing some horses and suspicious persons, and from there I marched all night, reaching dawn at Cerro do Roque on the 23rd.\n\nAhead of said hill, I encountered a band of rebels, about 40 to 50 men, commanded by the self-styled Lieutenant-Colonel Silveira, from Encruzilhada, whom, despite the horses being somewhat heavy, I attacked, placing Lieutenant Isaías and Ensign Júlio at the front commanding the guerrilla, and Captain Rafael Viana and Ensign Cruz in charge of the protection, with myself and the rest following; and said band was completely destroyed, with four men dead on the field and five prisoners, and it is believed many were wounded; leaving us some horses saddled with ordinary tack; the rest were pursued more than two leagues, until the entrance of the hills of Erval; and on that same day at 6 o’clock in the afternoon, I proceeded to the entrance of the path of the general mountain of Erval, which by its extent and rugged paths, I crossed with much difficulty in two nights and one day and came out at São João at dawn on the 25th.\n\nAnd recuperating there some horses, I sent Lieutenant Antônio Pedro de Abreu with 60 men down the pass of Duro to Arroio Velhaco, downstream Camaquã, recruiting the horses that appeared and making junction on the 26th at Butta with the said Lieutenant Abreu, who there, according to orders, had one hundred and some tame horses; from where at night I began to withdraw directly to the chapel of Dores, and from there to the pass of Araçá, where I arrived on the 28th, at 4 o’clock in the morning, where I waited for daybreak in order to open a path; and passing through it at 6 o’clock that day, I received news of a band of rebels waiting for me, and while changing horses, I sent Lieutenant Antônio Pedro de Abreu with 6 men on a reconnaissance, who, encountering the enemy’s reconnaissance party of 6 men, commanded by the Police Commander Ricardo, a deceitful, wicked rebel, swiftly attacked, capturing five and killing one; this, observed by the other enemies, they quickly withdrew, not giving my men a chance to work; and thus I proceeded to make junction with Your Excellency Ricardo and another similar one, son of Bento Surdo, and Jacinto Roque, justice of the peace of the rebels at Cerro do Roque, and six presented.\n\nThere was no breach whatsoever in the forces of legality, except for one of the 5th Corps who deserted. Thus fulfilled my measures and complied with the orders of Your Excellency, Senhor Dom Pedro Segundo.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.\n\nQuartered in Porto Alegre, December 31, 1839.  \nMost Illustrious and Exalted Sir Filipe Neri de Oliveira, Brigadier Commander of the 2nd Brigade.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel, Commander of the 5th Corps of National Guard."
