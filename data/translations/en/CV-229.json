  "translation": "Piratini, October 24, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nI am very glad to know that you and our children are well, that the godfather is improving, and that the godmother and your brothers are in good health. I, despite not leaving the bank with João da Cunha, suppose that I will not finish my writing yet in these twelve days, which greatly annoys me, for I want to hurry to seek means of rest and to educate our children. The three slaves I was expecting from Porto Alegre are on their way; without neglecting some plantation, however I think that first it is necessary to get the wagons ready to march, to some shelter, and that the yard be fenced with stakes, etc., etc. The saddles of José and Catraio, who go with the slaves, have them sent back at the first opportunity, or personally, so as not to be without them when needed. Send the enclosed letter to Florisbelo, asking him to send it as soon as possible.\n\nTell the godfather and godmother to consider this as from you, regards to cousin Carlota, to godmother Maria José, their children and parents, embraces to our children, and you receive the heart of your Almeida\n\nSend the enclosed letter with Lima’s horses."
