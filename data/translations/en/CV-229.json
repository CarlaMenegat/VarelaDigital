  "translation": "Piratini, October 24, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nI am very glad to know that you and our children are well, that the compadre is getting better, and that the comadre and your brothers are well. Although I have not left the bank with João da Cunha, I suppose I will not finish my writing even in these twelve days, which annoys me greatly, for I want to fly to seek means of rest and to educate our children. The three slaves I was expecting from Porto Alegre are on their way; without neglecting some plantation, however I think that first of all the carts should be put in marching order, under some arbor, and that the yard should be fenced with stakes, etc., etc. The saddles of José and Catraio who follow with the slaves, have them brought back at the first opportunity, or by myself, so as not to lack them when I need. Send to Florisbelo the enclosed letter, asking him to send it as quickly as possible.\n\nTell the compadre and comadre to consider this as from yours, regards to cousin Carlota, to comadre Maria José, her children and parents, hugs to our children, and you receive the heart of your Almeida\n\nWith Lima’s horses send the enclosed letter."
