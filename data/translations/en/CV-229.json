  "translation": "Piratini, October 24, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nI have greatly valued knowing that you and our children are well, that the compadre is improving, and that the comadre and your brothers are well. I, despite not leaving the bank with João da Cunha, suppose that I will not finish my writing even within these twelve days, which quite annoys me, for I wish to fly to seek means of rest and to educate our children. The three slaves I expected from Porto Alegre are coming; not neglecting some planting, however I think it is necessary first to put the carts in order for the march, in some arbour, and to fence the yard with stakes, etc., etc. The saddles of José and of Catraio that go with the slaves, have them returned on the first occasion, or by yourself, so that they do not lack me when I need them. Send to Florisbelo the enclosed letter, asking him to send it with the utmost speed.\n\nThe compadre and the comadre may consider this as from their own, regards to cousin Carlota, to comadre Maria José, their children and parents, embraces to our children, and you receive the heart of Yours, Almeida\n\nWith Lima’s horses, send the enclosed letter."
