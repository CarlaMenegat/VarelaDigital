  "translation": "I have quite esteemed to know that you and our children are well, that compadre is doing better, and that comadre and your brothers are well. I, despite not leaving the bench with João da Cunha, suppose that I will not finish my writing in these twelve days, which greatly annoys me, as I want to fly to seek means of rest and to educate our children. The three slaves I was expecting from Porto Alegre are coming; if there is no planting left, I still think that we should first put the carts in order to march, in some shelter, and that the yard should be enclosed with ditches, etc., etc. The little barrels of José and Catraio that are coming with the slaves should be returned at the first opportunity, or by themselves, so that I do not lack them when needed. Send Florisbelo the attached letter, asking him to send it as soon as possible."
