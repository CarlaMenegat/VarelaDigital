  "translation": "I know that they say I am hidden at home, perhaps because they do not see my letter in the mail, and for that reason from now on I will frequently address myself through that channel, and you will do the same, in order to quiet these holy people, who have so greatly promoted the good of the Province, and consequently ours and that of our children, for whose reward God will grant them. Here we enjoy much peace after the rebels have dispersed; however, the storm that Lord Araújo Ribeiro and his men have stirred still threatens great damage, although it is grim for those who promoted it.\n\nI enjoy good health but am exceedingly annoyed by being away from home for so long, away from you and our children. I know of the armament being prepared there for the expedition against this capital, but do not worry, and keep in mind what I recommended to you in my last letter, consulting me in person, above all, if you think it necessary."
