  "translation": "My dear Bernardina of the heart Porto Alegre, February 9, 1836.\n\nI know they say I am hidden at home, perhaps because they do not see any letter from me in the mail, and therefore from now on I will constantly write by this means, and you will do the same, in order to silence these good people, who have so much promoted the good of the Province, and consequently ours and that of our children, whose reward God will repay them. Here we enjoy much peace after the cabanos scattered; but the storm that Senhor Araújo Ribeiro and his have stirred up still threatens great damage, although it is frowning upon those who promoted it.\n\nI am in good health but exceedingly distressed for being away from home so long, separated from you and our children. I know of the armament being prepared there for the expedition against this capital, but do not be troubled, and keep in mind what I recommended in my last letters to you, consulting me in person, above all, if you find it necessary.\n\nRegards to our parents, compadre José Félix, sisters and everyone at home; embraces to our children, and you receive the heart of Your faithful Almeida.\n\nSeñor, Chevalier and David who have this for their own.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas. Porto Alegre.\n\n[Stamp on the back]"
