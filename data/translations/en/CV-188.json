  "translation": "My dear Bernardina of the heart Porto Alegre, February 9, 1836.\n\nI know they say I am hidden at home, perhaps because they do not see a letter from me by mail, and therefore from now on I will write constantly by this means, and you will do the same, in order to silence those holy people, who have done so much to promote the good of the Province, and consequently ours and that of our children, for whose payment God will reward them on our behalf. Here we enjoy much peace after the cabanos dispersed; but the storm that Senhor Araújo Ribeiro and his men have stirred still threatens great damage, although it is frowning upon those who promoted it.\n\nI enjoy health but am exceedingly weary from being away from home so long, absent from you and our children. I know of the armament being prepared there for the expedition against this capital, but do not trouble yourself, and keep in mind what I recommended to you in my last letters, consulting with me personally, above all else, if you think it necessary.\n\nRegards to our parents, compadre José Félix, siblings and everyone at home; embraces to our children, and you receive the heart of Your faithful Almeida.\n\nSenhor, Chevalier and David who have this as theirs.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas. Porto Alegre.\n\n[Stamp on the back]"
