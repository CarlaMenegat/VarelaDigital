  "translation": "Alongside are the titled Colonels Joaquim Pedro and José Mariano de Matos, and a captain and a soldier, as soon Your Excellency Antônio Manuel do Amaral went to the town of Jaguarão to loot with 150 men and was repelled by the police of Jaguarão, aided by infantry and navy, with the same Amaral dead, along with a lieutenant and 5 or 6 soldiers, and wounded a lieutenant and 6 soldiers, and on our side we mourned the death of a sergeant; this is what the same captain, who is now imprisoned and was present at the attack, tells me; for now I have not received any official news; if the men of the 2nd Corps who stayed behind to bring arms have not yet left, Your Excellency Canguçu."
