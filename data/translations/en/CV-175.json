  "translation": "Having just confirmed, at 6 o'clock in the evening, that there was a plan to arrest me and all the individuals who were in that city this morning, some of them have run to inform me of the little sincerity with which I assured that everything was arranged in the way we desired. I cannot believe that a confidence was betrayed, which served as a beacon to free us from the fury of factions; and for this reason I beg you to tell me, frankly, how to conceal myself, in order not to be held responsible at any time for the consequences that may follow, given the deliberation in which I see many exposed what happened in the conference. I am beside myself and wish to be guided today about the matter."
