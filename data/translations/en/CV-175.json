  "translation": "Friend Senhor Viana\n\nIt now being 6 o’clock in the afternoon, and learning that they intended to arrest me and all the individuals who were found this morning in that city, some of them having fled and informed me of the lack of sincerity with which I assured that everything was arranged in the manner we wished. I cannot believe that a confidence, which served as a beacon to save us from the fury of parties, could be betrayed; and therefore I beg you to tell me, frankly, where to hide, so as not to be responsible, at any time, for the consequences that may follow, given the resolution in which I see many to whom I exposed what happened in the conference. I am beside myself and wish to be guided today on the matter.\n\nAt your house, 2nd of October, 1835. Your sincere friend (a) Almeida."
