  "translation": "Friend Senhor Viana\n\nIt being now just 6 o’clock in the afternoon, and knowing that they intended to arrest me and all the individuals who were found this morning in that city, some of them have fled and informed me of the little sincerity with which I assured that everything was arranged in the manner we wished. I cannot believe that a confidence, which served as a beacon to free us from the furies of factions, was betrayed; and for that reason I beg you to tell me, frankly, where to hide, so as not to be responsible, at any time, for the consequences that may follow, given the resolution in which I see many to whom I exposed what occurred at the conference. I feel as if beside myself and wish to be advised today itself on the matter.\n\nYour home, October 2, 1835. Your sincere friend Almeida."
