  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that Portinho was gathering the stragglers at Santa Maria, and to assist this assembly came Carvalhinho; today I march with over one hundred cavalrymen and the 3rd Battalion to protect a point in case it is necessary. I sent on the business wagons of Miller which had not yet departed due to the rain; when I arrived the Lieutenant Colonel Melo had already bought most of the little cottons; today a wagon leaves with the rest of the herb that was here; upon my return I will dispatch 200 alqueires of flour which is now being prepared; Miller is to deliver 6 rolls of tobacco bought at 14 réis per arroba, and the same Miller is to receive the amount.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency. São Pedro, August 4, 1841.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto, Brigadier Commander of the Army.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant Colonel."
