  "translation": "I participate in Your Excellency. Portinho was gathering the lost ones in Santa Maria, and to assist in said meeting came Carvalhinho; today I march with over a hundred cavalrymen and the 3rd Battalion to protect a point in case it is needed. I instructed the business wagons of Miller to proceed, which had not yet left due to the rain; when I arrived, Lieutenant Colonel Melo had already purchased most of the cotton; today a wagon is leaving with the rest of the herbs that were here; upon my return, I will send 200 alqueires of flour that are being prepared; Miller will deliver 6 rolls of tobacco purchased at 14 Rs each arroba, and the same amount Miller will receive."
