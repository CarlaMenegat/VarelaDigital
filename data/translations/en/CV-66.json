  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nI inform Your Excellency that Portinho was gathering the lost men in Santa Maria and to assist this meeting Carvalhinho came; today I am marching with one hundred and some cavalrymen and the 3rd Battalion for protection at a point, in case it is needed. I have sent the Miller's business carts that had not yet left because of the rain; when I arrived, Lieutenant-Colonel Melo had already bought most of the little cottons; today a cart is leaving with the rest of the herb that was here; upon my return I will send 200 alqueires of flour which is being finished preparing; Miller will deliver 6 rolls of tobacco bought at 14 réis per arroba, and the same Miller will receive the payment.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nSão Pedro, August 4, 1841  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto  \nBrigadier Commander of the Army  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant-Colonel"
