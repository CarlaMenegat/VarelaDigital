  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nI inform Your Excellency that Portinho was gathering the lost ones in Santa Maria, and to assist this meeting Carvalhinho came; today I march with a hundred and some cavalrymen and the 3rd Battalion for protection at a point in case it is necessary. I had the Miller's business carts sent on, which had not yet started because of the rain; when I arrived, Lieutenant-Colonel Melo had already bought most of the little cottons; today a cart departs with the rest of the herb that was here; upon my return I will have 200 alqueires of flour sent, which is nearly ready; Miller will deliver 6 rolls of tobacco bought at 14 réis per arroba, and Miller himself will receive the amount.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency. São Pedro, August 4, 1841.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto.  \nBrigadier Commander of the Army.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.  \nLieutenant-Colonel."
