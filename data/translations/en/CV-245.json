  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, July 26, 1838.\n\nI am already delayed in receiving news from you and the arrival of our children; God willing it is not due to health inconveniences.\n\nMy head is a little better; but I am quite troubled by lice and scabies, which is indeed what I was missing.\n\nRegards to all our family, embraces to our children, and you receive the heart of yours, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Mr. José Rodrigues Chaves."
