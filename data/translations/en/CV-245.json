  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, July 26, 1838.\n\nI have already been waiting long for news from you and the arrival of our children; God willing, it is not due to health inconveniences.\n\nMy head is a little better; however, I am quite troubled by lice and scabies, which is indeed what I was missing.\n\nRegards to all our loved ones, hugs to our children, and you receive the heart of Your Almeida.\n\nMadam Mrs. José Rodrigues Chaves."
