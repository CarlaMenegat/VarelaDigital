  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nIn view of the copy of the official letter enclosed, Your Excellency shall see that Mr. Prado explains; more than 4 days ago he had already ordered Mr. Manuel Alves Manuel Alvares to proceed to the vicinity of Ibirocaí to join Major Carneiro, who was there with 50 men, already waiting for this very purpose, leaving Captain Fortunato with 20 men in Santa Ana, and until today nothing has been accomplished; I also sent official orders to the commanders who had meetings, also to join the same major, an officer whom, out of necessity, I resorted to, he not being exempt from answering for the crime he committed; and since until now none have arrived, and in view of the official letter, I shall have to march already with the men I could gather, which shall be Your Excellency’s concern.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nBarracks at Alegrete, November 22, 1837.  \nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira  \nColonel and Commander of the Right Division  \nJosé Inácio da Silva Abreu  \nLieutenant-Colonel Interim Commander of the Frontier."
