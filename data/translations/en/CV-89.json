  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir,\n\nIn view of the copy of the official letter, Your Lordship will see that Your Lordship Senhor Prado explains; more than 4 days ago he had already ordered Senhor Manuel Alves Manuel Alvares to proceed to the vicinity of Ibirocaí to meet with Major Carneiro, who was there with 50 men, already waiting for this very purpose, leaving Senhor Capitão Fortunato with 20 men in Santa Ana, and until today nothing has been carried out; I also wrote to the commanders who had meetings, also to meet the same major, an officer whom, due to necessity, I employed, not exempting him from responsibility for the crime he committed; and since none have arrived until now, and in view of the letter, I should already be marching with the persons I could gather, which Your Lordship will oversee.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship.\n\nBarracks in Alegrete, November 22, 1837.  \nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira, Colonel and Commander of the Right Division.  \nJosé Inácio da Silva Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel Interim Commander of the Frontier."
