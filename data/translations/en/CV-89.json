  "translation": "In view of the copy of the letter enclosed, Your Excellency will see that Mr. Prado explains; it has been more than 4 days since I ordered Mr. Manuel Alves Manuel Alvares to proceed to the vicinity of Ibirocaí to meet with Major Carneiro, who was there with 50 men, already waiting for this very thing, leaving Captain Fortunato with 20 men in Santa Ana, and to this day nothing has been fulfilled; I also notified the commanders who had meetings to also gather with the same major, this officer whom I had to resort to due to necessity, not exempting him from answering for the crime he committed; and since nothing has arrived up to now, and in light of the letter, I should march already with the people I could gather, who will be under Your Excellency’s command."
