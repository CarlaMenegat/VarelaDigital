  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nIn view of the copy of the letter attached, Your Excellency will see that Mr. Prado explains; more than 4 days ago he had already ordered Mr. Manuel Alves Manuel Alvares to proceed to the vicinity of Ibirocaí to join Major Carneiro, who was there with 50 men, already waiting for this very thing, leaving Captain Fortunato with 20 men in Santa Ana, and until today nothing has been carried out; I also wrote to the commanders who had gatherings, also to join the same major, this officer being one whom, due to necessity, I resorted to, not exempting him from answering for the crime he committed; and since until now none have arrived, and in view of the letter, I should already be marching with the people I was able to gather, who will be with Your Excellency.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nBarracks in Alegrete, November 22, 1837.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira  \nColonel and Commander of the Right Division.  \nJosé Inácio da Silva Abreu  \nLieutenant Colonel Interim Commander of the Frontier."
