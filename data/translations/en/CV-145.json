  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir,\n\nThe government has received your letter of the 23rd of this month and acknowledges what Your Excellency Captain Félix has reported concerning the enemy's movements.\n\nThe government has nothing to add to what it ordered you on the date of yesterday, but expects that you will frequently communicate everything that happens, both regarding your march and that of Colonel Crescêncio, as well as the enemy's movements. Yesterday Lieutenant Manuel Antônio was sent with all the regular troops and the cavalry that could be arranged, to the point that we were left with only a few men for butchering.\n\nIf Your Excellency Juca Cipriano, Fialho, etc., remained in the rear guard, the government expects you to promptly inform it so that appropriate measures may be taken.\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency.  \nSecretariat of War Affairs  \nVacacaí, March 24, 1840  \n\nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira, Commander of the Right Division.  \nWherever you may be.  \nFrom the Ministry of War."
