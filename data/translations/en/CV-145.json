Yesterday, Lieutenant Manuel Antônio was dispatched with all the regular soldiers and as many cavalry as could be arranged, to the point that we were left with only a few men for slaughtering.\n\nIf Your Excellency Juca Cipriano, Fialho, etc., remained in the rear guard, the government expects you to promptly inform it so that the necessary measures can be taken.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency\n\nSecretariat of War Affairs  \nVacacaí, March 24, 1840\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira,  \nCommander of the Right Division,  \nWherever you may be found.\n\nFrom the Ministry of War."
