  "translation": "The government received your dispatch of the 23rd of this month and is aware of what Your Excellency Captain Félix reports regarding the enemy's movements.\n\nThe government has nothing to add to what it ordered yesterday, but it expects you to communicate frequently about everything that occurs, both regarding your march and that of Colonel Crescêncio, as well as the enemy's movements. Yesterday, Lieutenant Manuel Antônio was sent with all the available infantry and cavalry that could be arranged, leaving us with only a few men for butchering.\n\nIf Your Excellency Juca Cipriano, Fialho, etc., remained in the rear, the government expects you to inform it promptly so that appropriate measures can be taken."
