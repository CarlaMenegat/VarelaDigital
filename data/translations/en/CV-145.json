  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nThe government received your letter dated the 23rd of this month and is assured by what Your Excellency Captain Félix has reported concerning the enemy's movements.\n\nThe government has nothing to add to what it ordered you on the previous day, but expects you to frequently communicate everything that occurs, both regarding your march and that of Colonel Crescêncio, as well as about the enemy's movements. Yesterday, Lieutenant Manuel Antônio was sent with all the foot soldiers and as many horsemen as could be arranged, to the point that only a few men were left to butcher.\n\nIf Your Excellency Juca Cipriano, Fialho, and others remained in the rear guard, the government expects prompt communication of this in order to take the appropriate measures.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nSecretary of War Affairs  \nVacacaí, March 24, 1840  \n\nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira,  \nCommander of the Right Division  \nWherever you may be  \nFrom the Ministry of War"
