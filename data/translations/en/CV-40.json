  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nLieutenant Colonel Cláudio de Abreu states that he has been in possession for nearly twenty-nine years of a farm called Inhanduí, where he has improvements of great value, situated in fields granted to him by a Sesmaria Charter extending one league in front and three in depth, bordering to the North with the estuary where the Ibirapuitã joins the Inhanduí, facing to the South a ridge, to the East a marsh that serves as a boundary to the lands of José Antônio de Siqueira, and also to the East and West dividing with the same Inhanduí up to its estuary.\n\nAnd because these fields have not yet been measured and demarcated, and the Petitioner presumes that within the aforementioned boundaries there are remnants of that sesmaria, fearing that someone else may claim them to the detriment of the Petitioner, given that he cannot admit another resident as it is a single hamlet, he requests from Your Excellency\n\nI Hope to Receive Justice Alegrete, February 21, 1843. Cláudio de Abreu\n\nIf the petitioner’s claim depends on legislative measure, refer it to the General Constituent and Legislative Assembly of the State. Office of the Interior, in Alegrete, February 25, 1843. Sá Brito"
