  "translation": "Lieutenant Colonel Cláudio de Abreu states that he has possessed a farm called Inhanduí for nearly twenty-nine years, where he has valuable improvements, located in fields granted to him by Land Grant for a stretch of one league in front and three in depth, bordered to the North by the mouth where the Ibirapuitã meets the Inhanduí, facing South with a knoll, to the East with a marsh that serves as a boundary to the fields of José Antônio de Siqueira, and also to the East and West dividing with the same Inhanduí until its mouth.\n\nAnd because these fields have not yet been measured and marked, and the Petitioner presumes that within the aforementioned boundaries there may be surplus from that land grant, fearing that another individual might claim them to the detriment of the Petitioner, since he cannot admit another inhabitant as it is a single area, he requests Your Excellency."
