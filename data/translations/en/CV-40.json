  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nLieutenant Colonel Cláudio de Abreu states that he has been in possession for nearly twenty-nine years of a farm called Inhanduí, where he has improvements of great value, situated in fields that were granted to him by Carta de Sesmaria extending one league in front and three in depth, bordered to the North by the estuary where the Ibirapuitã joins the Inhanduí, facing to the South a hillock, to the East a swamp that serves as a boundary to the fields of José Antônio de Siqueira, and also to the East and to the West dividing with the same Inhanduí up to its estuary.\n\nAnd because these fields have not yet been measured and demarcated, and the Petitioner presumes that within the aforementioned boundaries there may be surplus from that sesmaria, fearing that someone else may claim them to the detriment of the Petitioner, on the grounds that no other inhabitant can be admitted as it is a single ranch, he requests of Your Excellency\n\nI hope to receive justice Alegrete, February 21, 1843. Cláudio de Abreu\n\nIf the petitioner’s request depends on legislative measure, refer it to the General Constituent and Legislative Assembly of the State. Secretariat of the Interior, in Alegrete, February 25, 1843. Sá Brito"
