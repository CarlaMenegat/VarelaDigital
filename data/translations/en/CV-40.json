  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nLieutenant Colonel Cláudio de Abreu states that he has been in possession for nearly twenty-nine years of a farm called Inhanduí, where he has improvements of great value, situated in fields that were granted to him by Sesmaria Charter with an extension of one league front and three leagues deep, bordering on the North the estuary where the Ibirapuitã joins the Inhanduí, facing on the South a hillock, on the East a marsh that serves as the boundary to the lands of José Antônio de Siqueira, and also on the East and the West dividing with the same Inhanduí up to its estuary.\n\nAnd because these fields have not yet been measured and demarcated, and the Petitioner presumes that within the above-mentioned boundaries there are surplus lands from that sesmaria, fearing that someone else might claim them to the detriment of the Petitioner, since he cannot admit another occupant because it is a single homestead, he requests Your Excellency\n\nI hope to Receive Justice Alegrete, February 21, 1843. Cláudio de Abreu\n\nAs the petitioner’s claim depends on legislative measure, refer it to the General Constituent and Legislative Assembly of the State. Interior Secretariat, in Alegrete, February 25, 1843. Sá Brito"
