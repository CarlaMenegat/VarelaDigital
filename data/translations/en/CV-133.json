  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nHaving brought to the government’s knowledge the office of Your Excellency No. 18 of this month, in which Your Excellency announces São Paulo with four pieces of artillery, His Excellency, the Most Excellent Senhor Bento Manuel Ribeiro, touches exclusively on the initiative of this detail: he is in charge of operations, not only in the municipality of Cruz Alta, but also over that of Lages.\n\nBy the attached copy, Your Excellency will see Saturnino increase the number of his forces to deceive the blind credulity of the foolish populace, giving 1200 men coming from São Paulo, a number with which I also do not sympathize, because we know the obstacles, the stumblings they should encounter and overcome on such a long route; and if indeed this number did come, as I doubt, these people are not in a condition to fight with ours.\n\nAs for what Your Excellency Frutuoso, with the greatest number possible, directed to Cachoeira, where the Most Excellent ordered\n\nCaptain Laurindo remains in this capital with only 40 men, to secure its vicinity against the thieves, for although Dedeco was beaten by a detachment of Major Ismael, we still know that he has already crossed to this side.\n\nThe gathering of men is general today at all points of the State, some to reinforce the Division of Colonel Crescêncio, because the enemy threatens an imminent crossing at São Gonçalo, as can be seen from their movements, others to march to Rio Pardo as a consequence of the details and arrangements of the Most Excellent\n\nAllow me, however, Your Excellency São Paulo.\n\nColonel Teixeira ascended through the Torres with Garibaldi with 120 infantry and 80 cavalrymen; Lieutenant-Colonel Aranha, Portinho should have 200, according to the reports that have come to the government; Lieutenant-Colonel Guedes, Your Excellency’s 2nd Corps of Lancers, at least 100, besides the force from the municipality of São Borja; and not counting the men that Your Excellency Agostinho should rightly number at 200 men.\n\nAll these forces gathered or combined under the command of the Most Excellent Bento Manuel Ribeiro, when not sufficient to fight the enemy, will serve to hold off until they can be increased by others who become available.\n\nThat is all the government has to say to Your Excellency.\n\nSecretary of War in Caçapava, December 22, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira.\n\nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
