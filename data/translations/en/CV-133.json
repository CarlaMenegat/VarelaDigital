  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nHaving brought to the attention of the government Your Excellency's letter number 18 of this month, in which Your Excellency announces São Paulo with four cannons, His Excellency Senhor His Excellency the Most Illustrious Bento Manuel Ribeiro exclusively touches upon the initiative of this detail: he is in charge of the operations, not only in the municipality of Cruz Alta, but also over that of Lages.\n\nBy the attached copy Your Excellency will see Saturnino increase the number of his forces to deceive the blind credulity of the stupid populace, giving 1200 men coming from São Paulo, a number with which I also do not agree, because we know the difficulties, the obstacles they would have to encounter and overcome on such a long route; and if in fact that number came, as I doubt, those men are not in a condition to fight with ours.\n\nAs for what Your Excellency Frutuoso, with the greatest possible number, directed towards Cachoeira, to where the Most Illustrious ordered.\n\nCaptain Laurindo remains in this capital with only 40 men, to secure its vicinity from the bandits, for although Dedeco was beaten by a detachment of Major Ismael, however we know that he has already crossed to this side.\n\nThe gathering of men is general today at all points of the State, some to reinforce the Division of Colonel Crescêncio, because the enemy threatens an imminent crossing at São Gonçalo, as seen from their movements, others to march to Rio Pardo in consequence of the details and arrangements of the Most Illustrious.\n\nAllow me, however, Your Excellency São Paulo.\n\nColonel Teixeira advanced through Torres with Garibaldi with 120 infantry and 80 cavalry; Lieutenant Colonel Aranha, Portinho should have 200 according to the reports that have come to the government; Lieutenant Colonel Guedes, Your Excellency 2nd Corps of Lancers, at least 100, in addition to the force from the municipality of São Borja; and not counting the men that Your Excellency Agostinho must certainly count on 200 men.\n\nAll these forces gathered or combined under the command of the Most Illustrious Bento Manuel Ribeiro, when insufficient to fight the enemy, will serve to hold the line until they can be increased by others that become available.\n\nThat is all the government has to say to Your Excellency.\n\nSecretary of War in Caçapava, December 22, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira.\n\nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
