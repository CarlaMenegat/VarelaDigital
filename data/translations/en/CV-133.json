  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nHaving brought to the government’s attention Your Excellency’s letter no. 18 on the current matter, in which Your Excellency announces São Paulo with four pieces of artillery, His Excellency Mr. His Excellency the Most Excellent Bento Manuel Ribeiro owns exclusively the initiative of this matter: he is in charge of the operations, not only in the municipality of Cruz Alta, but also over that of Lages.\n\nBy the attached copy Your Excellency will see Saturnino increase the number of his forces to deceive the blind credulity of the stupid commoners, giving 1200 men coming from São Paulo, a number with which I also do not sympathize, because we know the obstacles, the setbacks they should encounter and overcome in such a long route; and if indeed that number came, as I doubt, those people are not in a condition to fight with ours.\n\nAs for what Your Excellency Frutuoso has, with the greatest possible number, in the direction of Cachoeira, where His Excellency ordered\n\nCaptain Laurindo remains in this capital with only 40 men, to secure its surroundings from thieves, since although Dedeco was beaten by a detachment of Major Ismael, we nevertheless know he has already crossed over to this side.\n\nThe gathering of men is general today at all points of the State, some to reinforce the Division of Colonel Crescêncio, because the enemy threatens an imminent crossing at São Gonçalo, according to their movements, others to march to Rio Pardo following the details and arrangements of His Excellency\n\nAllow, however, Your Excellency São Paulo.\n\nColonel Teixeira advanced through Torres with Garibaldi with 120 infantry and 80 cavalrymen; Lieutenant-Colonel Aranha, Portinho is said to have 200, according to the reports that have been sent to the government; Lieutenant-Colonel Guedes, Your Excellency’s 2nd Corps of Lancers, at least 100, besides the force of the municipality of São Borja; and not counting the men that Your Excellency Agostinho should count certainly 200 men.\n\nAll these forces gathered or combined under the command of the Most Excellent Bento Manuel Ribeiro, when not sufficient to defeat the enemy, will serve to hold off until they can be reinforced by others that become available.\n\nThat is all the government has to say to Your Excellency.\n\nWar Secretariat, Caçapava, December 22, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira.\n\nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
