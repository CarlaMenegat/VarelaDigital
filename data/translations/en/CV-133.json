  "translation": "Having brought to the government’s attention the letter from Your Honor 18 regarding what governs, in which Your Honor announces São Paulo with four mouths of fire, His Excellency Mr. His Excellency the Most Excellent Bento Manuel Ribeiro is exclusively responsible for the initiative of this detail: he is in charge of operations not only in the municipality of Cruz Alta but also in Lages.\n\nBy the attached copy, Your Honor will see Saturnino increasing the number of his forces to deceive the blind credulity of the foolish crowd, giving 1200 men coming from São Paulo, a number with which I am also not sympathetic, because we know the difficulties and obstacles they would encounter and have to overcome on such a long journey; and if this number truly arrived, as I doubt, these people are not in a state to fight with ours.\n\nAs for what Your Honor Frutuoso, with the largest number possible, has ordered to Cachoeira, where the Most Excellent has commanded.\n\nCaptain Laurindo remains in this capital with only 40 men to secure their proximity from thieves, for although Dedeco was defeated by a party from Major Ismael, we know he has already crossed to this side.\n\nThe gathering of people is general today at all points of the State, some to reinforce the Division of Colonel Crescêncio, because the enemy threatens an imminent crossing at São Gonçalo, as seen from their movements, others to march towards Rio Pardo as a consequence of the details and arrangements of the Most Excellent.\n\nHowever, allow it, Your Honor São Paulo.\n\nColonel Teixeira ascended by the Torres with Garibaldi with 120 infantry and 80 cavalrymen; Lieutenant Colonel Aranha, Portinho should have 200, according to the reports that have come to the government; Lieutenant Colonel Guedes, Your Honor 2nd Corps of Lancers, at least 100, plus the force from the municipality of São Borja; and not counting the men that Your Honor Agostinho should certainly account for 200 men.\n\nAll these combined forces under the command of the Most Excellent Bento Manuel Ribeiro, if they are not sufficient to defeat the enemy, will serve to hold out until they can be reinforced by others that remain available."
