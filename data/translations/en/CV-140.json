  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nThe government, sufficiently informed of the essence of the sole letter from Your Excellency dated the 6th of last month, has ordered me to respond to Your Excellency.\n\nFortunately, the government acknowledges how much Your Excellency, First Line, authorizes Your Excellency\n\nA detachment from the First Line corps can in no way be useful. The soldier out of his corps loses the military habit, forgets discipline, and contracts the vice of insubordination, besides that, when they become demoralized, they are the worst members of society. If the indicated measure still does not please Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nSecretariat of War Affairs in Caçapava, March 9, 1840.  \n\nMost Illustrious Sir Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães, Chief of Police of the Boqueirão Department.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nLetter from the Excellent [office], March 9, received on the 22nd of the same month, regarding the police, smugglers, etc."
