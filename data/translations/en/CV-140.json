  "translation": "The government, sufficiently informed of the essence of the sole office that Your Excellency held in the past, ordered me to respond to Your Excellency.\n\nFortunately, the government recognizes how much Your Excellency authorizes.\n\nA detachment from the 1st Line corps cannot in any way be useful. A soldier outside of his unit loses military habit, forgets discipline, and acquires the vice of insubordination; moreover, when they become demoralized, they are the worst members of society. If this indicated measure still does not please Your Excellency,"
