  "translation": "After leaving the chapel of Dores, near Camaquã, on the 20th of this current month, I reported to Your Excellency on the 7th of this current month at 3 o'clock in the morning, when I set off on the journey with four steam boats and three horse ferries, landing on the right bank of the lagoon, beyond Camaquã, according to the orders and instructions of Your Excellency.\n\nI then continued, on the 21st of this current month, from the aforementioned chapel of Dores, with the entire cavalry and infantry force, directly to the charqueadas of Barra, a distance of ten leagues, and there, on the 22nd, embarking the infantry on the steam boat to the capital of Porto Alegre, I continued the same day with the cavalry and horses directly to the post at Ponta Rasa, a distance of over eight leagues, where I arrived safely on the 23rd and where I am following the orders of Your Excellency, Captain Lieutenant Meneses, and the other commanders of the steam boats, as well as on the land journeys and diligences, throughout the entire cavalry and infantry, particularly praising the subordination and discipline upheld by your worthy and illustrious Major Francisco de Lima e Silva. Of the 520 horses gathered, I passed receipt for some, of which, as soon as possible, I will send to Your Excellency, Colonel Commander of the Garrison of the village of the North, Antônio Soares de Paiva, 29 eared horses, with the delivery of 32, but three were reunited, and these 32 horses do not count in the total of 520.\n\nThroughout the expedition, there was no break whatsoever; the orders of Your Excellency."
