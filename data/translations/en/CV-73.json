  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nAfter leaving the Chapel of Sorrows, below Camaquã, on the 20th of the current month, I informed Your Excellency on the 7th of the current month at 3 o’clock in the morning that I set out on a journey in four steam barges and three horse ferries, to disembark on the right bank of the lagoon, beyond Camaquã, according to the orders and instructions of Your Excellency.\n\nI then proceeded, on the 21st of the current month, from the said Chapel of Sorrows, with all the cavalry and infantry forces, directly to the Charqueadas da Barra, a distance of ten leagues, and there, on the 22nd, embarking the infantry on the steamboat for the capital of Porto Alegre, I continued on the same day with the cavalry and horses directly to the Ponta Rasa detachment, a distance of over eight leagues, where I arrived safely on the 23rd and where Lieutenant-Captain Meneses and the other commanders of the steam barges, as well as those on land journeys and courier services, remain following the orders of Your Excellency, with all the cavalry and infantry. Among them, particular commendation is due for the subordination and discipline brought by the worthy Most Illustrious Sir Major Francisco de Lima e Silva. Of the 520 horses gathered, I have received receipts for some; and as soon as possible, I will remit to Your Excellency, Colonel Commander of the Garrison of the town of the North, Antônio Soares de Paiva, 29 captured horses, there being a delivery of 32, but three were revertants, and these 32 horses are not included in the count of the 520.\n\nThroughout the entire expedition, there was not a single breach of Your Excellency’s orders.\n\nMay God guard Your Excellency  \nDetachment at Ponta Rasa, December 23, 1842  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir, Baron of Caxias, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Army.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant Colonel."
