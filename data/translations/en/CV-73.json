  "translation": "Most Illustrious Excellent Sir\n\nAfter leaving the chapel of the Sorrows, on this side of Camaquã, on the 20th of the current month, I informed Your Excellency on the 7th of the current month at 3 o’clock in the morning, when I set out on the journey on four steam barges and three horse ferries, to disembark on the right bank of the lagoon, beyond Camaquã, according to the orders and instructions of Your Excellency.\n\nI then proceeded, on the 21st of the current month, from the said chapel of the Sorrows, with the entire force of cavalry and infantry, straight to the charqueadas of Barra, a distance of ten leagues, and there, on the 22nd, embarking the infantry on the steamer to the capital of Porto Alegre, I proceeded on the same day with the cavalry and horses directly to the detachment of Ponta Rasa, a distance of more than eight leagues, where it arrived safely on the 23rd and where Captain-lieutenant Meneses and the other commanders of the steam barges, as well as on the land journeys and diligences, continue to find the cavalry and infantry under the orders of Your Excellency, Sir. The infantry deserves special praise for the subordination and discipline maintained by its worthy Most Illustrious Sir Major Francisco de Lima e Silva. Of the 520 horses assembled, I received receipts for some, of which, as soon as possible, I shall remit to Your Excellency Colonel Commander of the Garrison of the Vila do Norte, Antônio Soares de Paiva, 29 eared horses, the delivery being 32, but three were runaway, and these 32 horses do not count among the 520.\n\nIn the entire expedition there was no breach; the orders of Your Excellency\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency Detachment at Ponta Rasa, 23 December 1842.  \nMost Illustrious Excellent Sir, Barão de Caxias, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Army.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant-Colonel."
