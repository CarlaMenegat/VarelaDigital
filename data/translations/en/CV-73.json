  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nAfter departing from the Chapel of Sorrows, beyond Camaquã, on the 20th of the current month, I informed Your Excellency on the 7th of the current month at 3 o’clock in the morning, when I set out on the journey with four steam barges and three horse ferries, to disembark on the right bank of the lagoon, beyond Camaquã, according to Your Excellency's orders and instructions.\n\nI then proceeded, on the 21st of the current month, from the said Chapel of Sorrows, with the full force of cavalry and infantry, directly to the charqueadas of Barra, a distance of ten leagues, and there, on the 22nd, embarking the infantry on the steamer bound for the capital of Porto Alegre, I continued on the same day with the cavalry and horses straight to the detachment at Ponta Rasa, a distance of more than eight leagues, where I arrived safely on the 23rd, and where, according to Your Excellency’s orders, Lieutenant-Captain Meneses and other commanders of the steam barges, as well as on land journeys and diligences, command all the cavalry and infantry, in which the subordination and discipline brought by its worthy Most Illustrious Sir Major Francisco de Lima e Silva deserve even greater praise. Of the 520 horses gathered, I passed receipt for some, of which, as soon as possible, I will forward to Your Excellency Colonel Commander of the Garrison of the town of the North, Antônio Soares de Paiva, 29 branded horses, the delivery being of 32, but three were arrested, and these 32 horses are not counted among the 520.\n\nThere was no breach whatsoever in the entire expedition; Your Excellency's orders\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nDetachment at Ponta Rasa, December 23, 1842  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir,  \nBaron of Caxias, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Army.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant-Colonel."
