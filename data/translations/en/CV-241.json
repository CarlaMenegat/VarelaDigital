  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, May 7, 1838.\n\nThe condition of Epaminondas and Aristides has greatly troubled me, as you informed me in your letter of the 5th of this month, which I received yesterday through José; but since I sent you the medicines yesterday by the Frenchman Sarasin, I hope they will improve with them, and if that does not happen, you will notify me promptly so that others can be applied. Be firm and careful with them.\n\nRegarding the flour from José Rodrigues, you will demand nothing, rather let him see that it cost nothing. Do not fear Silva Tavares, because besides the President being before him, in these three days Lieutenant-Colonel Guedes with 500 men and Lieutenant-Colonel Felicissimo with 180 should join him. It was wise to withdraw the slaves, who should not return until the present crisis has calmed.\n\nTell the godfather that I very much esteem seeing him in accordance with the dispositions of heaven: decrees that cannot be revoked.\n\nTomorrow there will be a sung mass and funeral office for your brother, who is buried in a catacomb in the cemetery of this place.\n\nI esteem, as you know, all your brothers; however, I doubt that they cost me as many sorrows as I have suffered with the death of Bernardino. Cousin Marucas, Mateus, D. Francisca and João da Costa send you thousands of regards and so does everyone at home in general; I do the same, sending tender embraces to our children and to you, the heart of\n\nYour Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida — Bom Retiro, at the house of Mr. José Rodrigues Chaves."
