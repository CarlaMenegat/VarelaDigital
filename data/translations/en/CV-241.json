  "translation": "I have been quite troubled by the state of Epaminondas and Aristides, as you announced to me in your letter of the 5th of this month, which I received yesterday through José; but since I sent you the remedies yesterday via French Sarasin, I am confident that they will improve with them, and if that does not happen, you will promptly inform me so that others can be applied. Be careful with Bruto and Custódia.\n\nRegarding the flour from José Rodrigues, you should not demand anything; rather, you will make him see that it cost nothing. Do not be afraid of Silva Tavares, because in addition to the President being in front of him, in these three days the Lieutenant Colonel Guedes with 500 men should join him, as well as the Lieutenant Colonel Felicissimo with 180. It was wise to withdraw the slaves, who should not return until the current crisis has calmed down.\n\nTell the compadre that I very much appreciate seeing him in accordance with the dispositions of heaven: decrees that cannot be revoked.\n\nTomorrow, there will be a sung Mass and a funeral service for your brother, who is buried in a catacomb in the holy ground of this place.\n\nAs you know, I care for all your brothers; however, I doubt that they will cause me as much grief as I have suffered with the death of Bernardino. Prima Marucas, Mateus, D. Francisca, and João da Costa send you many regards and to everyone at home in general; I do the same, sending warm hugs to our children and to you, the heart of."
