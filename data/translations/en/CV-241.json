  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, May 7, 1838.\n\nThe condition of Epaminondas and Aristides has greatly distressed me, as you informed me in your letter of the 5th of this month, which I received yesterday through José; but since I already sent you the medicines yesterday by the Frenchman Sarasin, I expect they will improve with them, and if that does not happen, you will inform me promptly so that others may be applied. Be strict and cautious with them.\n\nRegarding the flour from José Rodrigues, you shall demand nothing, rather show him that it cost nothing. Do not fear Silva Tavares, because besides having the President before him, within these three days Lieutenant Colonel Guedes with 500 men and Lieutenant Colonel Felicissimo with 180 should join him. It was prudent to withdraw the slaves, who should not return until this present crisis has calmed.\n\nTell the godfather that I esteem him greatly to see him in accordance with the dispositions of heaven: decrees that cannot be revoked.\n\nTomorrow there will be a sung mass and funeral service for your brother, who lies buried in a catacomb in the cemetery of this place.\n\nI esteem, as you know, all your brothers; however, I doubt they will cost me as much sorrow as I have suffered with the death of Bernardino. Cousin Marucas, Mateus, D. Francisca, and João da Costa send you thousands of regards and greetings to everyone at home in general; I do the same, sending tender embraces to our children and to you the heart of\n\nYours, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida — Bom Retiro, at the home of Senhor José Rodrigues Chaves."
