  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, May 7, 1838.\n\nI have been quite distressed by the condition of Epaminondas and Aristides, as you informed me in your letter of the 5th of this month, which I received yesterday through José; but since I already sent you the medicines yesterday by the Frenchman Sarasin, I hope they will improve with them, and if that does not happen, you will notify me promptly so that others may be applied. Bruto and Custódia, be careful with them.\n\nRegarding the flour from José Rodrigues, do not demand anything, rather show him that it cost nothing. Do not fear Silva Tavares, because besides the President being before him, within these three days Lieutenant Colonel Guedes with 500 men and Lieutenant Colonel Felicissimo with 180 should join him. It was prudent to withdraw the slaves, who must not return until after the present crisis has calmed.\n\nTell the godfather that I greatly esteem seeing him in accordance with the decrees of heaven: decrees that cannot be revoked.\n\nTomorrow there will be a sung mass and funeral office for your brother, who is buried in a catacomb in the cemetery of this place.\n\nAs you know, I esteem all your brothers; however, I doubt they have caused me as many sorrows as I have suffered with the death of Bernardino. Cousin Marucas, Mateus, D. Francisca, and João da Costa send you thousands of regards and to all at home in general; I do the same, sending tender embraces to our children and to you the heart of\n\nYour Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida — Bom Retiro, at the house of Mr. José Rodrigues Chaves."
