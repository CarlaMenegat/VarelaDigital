  "translation": "Piratini, June 24, 1837.\n\nDear Bernardina,\n\nLast night I received yours of the 18th of this month, and to think maturely about what suits us, attentive to the circumstances of this and that country, I took all of today itself; and now, ten o'clock at night, I have made my decision on the matter. Have the carts prepared in marching order, because within these twenty days, counting from today, either we shall go together to Montevidéu, or I will send for you to come to this place; for being in Pedras Altas and being there is the same thing since we cannot be together.\n\nMoreover, my fears still expressed there are being confirmed, and in a manner whose results are frightening. My sacrifices would continue if I awaited a favorable outcome; but let us get out of the abyss before all is lost and our children are left without sustenance.\n\nWith this you will penetrate more deeply and have patience with the influence of fortune.\n\nRegards to our relatives, hugs to our dear children and accept the heart of your Almeida.\n\nHave given to Manuel Madruga Rs. 49$080, forty-nine thousand and eighty, and to cousin Bernardino Vieira 24 patacones, twenty-four patacones, and send the attached to Bruno and Victorica.\n\nAlmeida.\n\nTo the Illustrious Lady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Mangrulho."
