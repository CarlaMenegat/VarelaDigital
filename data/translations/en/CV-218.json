  "translation": "Last night I received your letter of the 18th of this month, and to think carefully about what is best for us, taking into account the circumstances of this country and yours, I spent the whole day today on it; and now, at ten o'clock at night, I have made my decision regarding it. Get the wagons ready in marching order, because within these twenty days, counting from today, we either must set out together for Montevideo, or I will send for you to come to this point; for being in Pedras Altas and being there is the same, since we cannot be together.\n\nFurthermore, my fears, which I have already expressed, are being realized in a way whose results are alarming. My sacrifices would continue if I were expecting a favorable outcome; but we must get out of the abyss before everything is lost and our children are left without sustenance. \n\nWith this, you will understand more, and have patience with the influence of fate."
