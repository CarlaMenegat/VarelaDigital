  "translation": "Piratini, June 24, 1837.\n\nDear Bernardina,\n\nLast night I received your letter of the 18th of this month, and to think carefully about what is best for us, considering the circumstances of this and that country, I delayed all day today; and now, at ten o'clock at night, I have made up my mind on the matter. Have the wagons prepared in marching order, because within these twenty days, counting from today, we will either proceed together to Montevideo, or I will send for you to come to this place; for being in Pedras Altas and being there is the same thing since we cannot be together.\n\nFurthermore, my fears still expressed there are proving true, and in a manner whose results are frightening. My sacrifices would continue if I expected a favorable outcome; but let us get out of the abyss before everything is lost and our children remain without support.\n\nWith this, you will understand more and have patience with the influence of fate.\n\nRemember our relatives, embrace our dear children, and accept the heart of yours, Almeida.\n\nHave Manuel Madruga given Rs. 49$080, forty-nine thousand and eighty, and cousin Bernardino Vieira 24 patacões, twenty-four patacões, and send the attached to Bruno and Victorica.\n\nAlmeida.\n\nIllustrious Lady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Mangrulho."
