  "translation": "Piratini, June 24, 1837.\n\nDear Bernardina\n\nLast night I received yours of the 18th of this month, and to think maturely about what is convenient for us, considering the circumstances of this and that country, I took the whole day today; and now, at ten o'clock at night, I have made up my mind about it. Have the carts prepared in order of march, because within twenty days from today, we will either go together to Montevideo, or I will send for you to come to this place; for being in the Pedras Altas and being there is the same thing since we cannot be together.\n\nMoreover, my fears still manifested there are being confirmed, and in a manner whose results are frightening. My sacrifices would continue if I awaited a favorable outcome; but let us leave the abyss before everything is lost and our children are left without sustenance.\n\nWith this you will understand more, and have patience with the influence of fate.\n\nRegards to our relatives, embraces to our dear children, and you accept the heart of your Almeida.\n\nHave Manuel Madruga given Rs. 49$080, forty-nine thousand and eighty, and cousin Bernardino Vieira 24 patacões, twenty-four patacões, and send the attached to Bruno and Victorica.\n\nAlmeida.\n\nIllustrious Lady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Mangrulho."
