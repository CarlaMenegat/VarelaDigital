  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that tonight the firefighter I sent to Boa Vista arrived, and he says that Bento Manuel is at Triunfo waiting for the rest of the men because he received orders from the leader of the looting to withdraw with the force and all the police to Piratini. He says this is because of a large legal force descending from the Upper Mountain; they also say that the gunboats have already fired much. Estevão offers to administer the fort and command the piece; and if Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency\n\nCamp Picada, November 14, 1838.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Tomás José da Silva.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.  \nMajor Commander of the Detachment of Picada."
