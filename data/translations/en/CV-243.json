  "translation": "I attest that while serving in the position of Quartermaster General, and on commission in the Eastern State after the 4th of January, 1837, the citizen Domingos José de Silveira Filho, 2nd sergeant of the 3rd Company of the Pelotas Squadron of the 4th Corps of the 1st Brigade, presented himself to me, stating that having passed through that State under the orders of Major Antônio Carlos de Soveral, and with the latter delaying his return to the army, he requested that I send him at the earliest opportunity, immediately employing him in whatever service was required; which I did by entrusting him with the herding and recruitment of the cavalry, and later with the transport of a portion thereof which I sent to the army, where he remains until now, displaying patriotism and conduct worthy of praise and the consideration of the government and his compatriots.\n\nThe aforementioned is true, and I will swear to it if necessary. City of Piratini, 30th May 1838.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida."
