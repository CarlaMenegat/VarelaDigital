  "translation": "I attest that, serving in the position of Quartermaster General, and on commission in the Eastern State after January 4, 1837, the citizen Domingos José de Silveira Filho, 2nd sergeant of the 3rd Company of the Pelotas Squadron of the 4th Corps of the 1st Brigade, presented himself to me, stating that having passed through that State under the orders of Major Antônio Carlos de Soveral, and with the latter delayed in returning to the army, I asked that he be sent to me at the first opportunity, immediately assigning him to whatever service was necessary; which I did, entrusting him with the herding and recruitment of the cavalry, and afterwards the transportation of a portion of it that I sent to the army, where he remains to this day, exhibiting patriotism and conduct worthy of praise and the consideration of the government and his compatriots.\n\nThe aforementioned is true and I will swear to it if necessary. City of Piratini, May 30, 1838.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida."
