  "translation": "I attest that while serving as Quartermaster General, and on commission in the Eastern State after January 4, 1837, the citizen Domingos José de Silveira Filho, 2nd sergeant of the 3rd Company of the Pelotas Squadron of the 4th Corps of the 1st Brigade, presented himself to me, narrating that having passed to that State under the orders of Major Antônio Carlos de Soveral, and his delay in returning to the army, he asked that I send him at the first opportunity, immediately occupying him with whatever service was necessary; which I did, putting him in charge of the herding and recruitment of the cavalry, and later of the conduct of a portion of it that I sent to the army, where it remains to this day, demonstrating a patriotism and conduct worthy of praise and of the contemplation of the government and his compatriots.\n\nThe aforementioned is true and I will swear if necessary. City of Piratini, May 30, 1838."
