  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart Porto Alegre, January 5, 1836.\n\nFrom Pedras Brancas I wrote to you informing you of my journey up to there, and now I do so for the pleasure that always accompanies me whenever I occupy myself with you, even if only by writing. Yesterday the Provincial Assembly resolved to give possession to President Araújo Ribeiro, in which, as much as I could, I concurred, and for this I challenged some indisposition against me; but it does not matter, because I prefer the good of the Province to that ephemeral popularity in times such as those we are going through, and thus the reactionaries were convinced that their deceptions were worth nothing this time. I will remain until the possession of the President, not only so that it is not thought that I withdraw for this reason, but also because I am resolved to go from here to Santa Ana to see if I promote the collection of what is owed to me at that point and São Gabriel. For this purpose I order João da Cunha to give me the accounts I request and send them to Bagé to compadre Rafael, so that I may find them when I pass by there. The city remains calm and everything promises peace, despite the dust that has been raised everywhere against republics that exist in the heads of people of good order, but which do not produce the effect they desired.\n\nRecommendations to all our people and tender embraces to our children, receiving you the longing heart of Your husband of the heart Almeida.\n\nPost scriptum Mister Chastan, and do not neglect the collection of Granja.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
