  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart  \nPorto Alegre, January 5, 1836.\n\nFrom Pedras Brancas I wrote to you giving an account of my journey up to there, and now I do so for the pleasure that always accompanies me whenever I engage with you, even if only in writing. Yesterday the Provincial Assembly resolved to give possession to President Araújo Ribeiro, in which I participated as much as I could, and for that reason I incurred some indisposition; but it does not matter, because I prefer the good of the Province to that ephemeral popularity in a time such as the one we are living through, and so the reactionaries were convinced that their deceptions were worth nothing this time. I am still staying until the President's inauguration, not only so that it may not be thought that I retire for that reason, but also because I am resolved to proceed from here to Santa Ana to see if I can promote the collection of what is owed to me at that point and in São Gabriel. For this purpose I order João da Cunha to make the accounts that I request from him and send them to Bagé to compadre Rafael, so that I may find them when I pass through there. The city remains calm and all promises peace, despite the dust that has been raised everywhere against republics that exist only in the minds of people of good order, but which do not produce the effect they desired.\n\nRecommendations to all our people and tender embraces to our children, you receiving the longing heart of  \nYour husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nPost scriptum: Mr. Chastan, and do not neglect the collection from Granja.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
