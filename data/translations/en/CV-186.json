  "translation": "From Pedras Brancas, I wrote to you informing you of my journey there, and now I write for the pleasure that accompanies me whenever I engage with you, even if just in writing. Yesterday, the Provincial Assembly decided to invest President Araújo Ribeiro, in which I participated as much as I could, and thus I challenged against some discomfort; but it does not matter, because I prefer the good of the Province to that ephemeral popularity in a time such as the one we are going through, and thus the reactionaries were convinced that their machinations were of no value this time. I will remain until the President's inauguration, not only so that it is not thought that I am withdrawing for this reason but also because I am determined to go from here to Santa Ana to see if I can promote the collection of what is owed to me at that point and São Gabriel. For this purpose, I order João da Cunha to prepare the accounts I request and send them to Bagé to comrade Rafael, so that I find them when I pass through there. The city remains peaceful and everything promises tranquility, despite the dust that has been raised everywhere against republics that exist in the minds of orderly people, but which are not producing the effect they desired.\n\nPost scriptum to Mr. Chastan, and that he does not neglect the collection from Granja."
