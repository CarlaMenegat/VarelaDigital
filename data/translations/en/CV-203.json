  "translation": "Copy — Most Illustrious Sir\n\nCommitted as you are, Senhor São Gonçalo, to the triumph of legality, I venture this to inform you that an attempt of an attack on the forces stationed here has been discovered, and consequently, ambushes are being set to surprise and destroy the force designated for that purpose. The fort is garrisoned with 250 infantry, 40 artillerymen, 80 cavalrymen, and 10 pieces of artillery. Besides this force, a squadron of 30 to 40 men at the Pelotas farm covers the left of the fort, located to the left of the river of the same name; at dusk, 100 infantrymen leave the fort and bivouac near that farm, carrying the two pieces of 9 and 6 taken from Junqueira’s schooner, and persist there with patrols to assist at the landing point. It is determined that at the outbreak of fire at any of these places, 40 infantrymen, who maintain order in the city, will cross the Blacks’ pass to garrison the Assunção side, and united they will defend the chain hastily placed in the river; these infantrymen are almost all mulattoes and blacks from the city, who with the escort of 15 horsemen from the other side of the Assunção must rush to that point. Just now a squadron of 86 men has returned, which going by Canguçu to Neto’s division returned because the latter followed Silva Tavares, who fled in the direction of Bagé; the squadron went to stay at Retiro, I suppose, not only to cover the point it is to occupy going otherwise to Pelotas, but also to spare the horses which can barely endure it. Neto’s brigade was reinforced with 130 men who came from the Eastern State under Lieutenant Bernardino Gomes, bringing 800 fat horses. In the report of this gathering, it is added that Paulino Fontoura crossed the Uruguay with 300 and some Entre Rianos and Correntinos; there was an order to also join Neto. At the same time, the famous Lavalleja entered to aid Oribe with 700 men, they say from those same places. Oribe, in a letter whose date I ignore, says that between this Province and that State the lines will be common so that those from here may pass against the unfortunate emigrants, and those from there against the fructistas; for this reason, immense parties have hurriedly gone out to gather the horses of the unfortunate emigrants, and 170 horses are found at the Blacks’ pass, sent by the Seráfico, an improvised ensign from the Chuí border. Two pieces of 36 and 24 found at Cebolati, by Major Julian Calderon were sent to the Liscano pass, and from there, Rio Grande 35 imaginary accomplices of a rebellion, I believe to pillage, as they pillaged their houses, and miserably they found 63 infantry weapons, pistols, swords, and more than 15 arrobas of gunpowder. The small escort that accompanied these victims of rapacity was commanded by Pedro Pinto; Joaquim Marques escaped by hiding, and may God permit that he is not caught, as the diligences multiply, as those to frustrate any landing; therefore, I beg you to desist from that enterprise, withdrawing already, to see if with the disappearance of those vessels relaxation will be reborn and I carry out the plan of buying soldiers with the aim of arresting the officers, for which I have already spent a lot and will spare no amount; but everything is stalled with the arrival of this force, which could not come at a worse time, due to the caution and activity in which things are found. The loyalty of my intentions and services already advanced beforehand moved me to make you this warning under the very risk you can imagine, and the purity of my feelings is such that I do not require a response, except if you deem it necessary. A launch must remain at the point of Sarangonha opposite Torotama, for me to communicate what occurs and that it does not leave from there, so as not to be perceived by the canoes that come and go to Rio Grande, Estreito, etc., etc., and to take new precautions. Every day I will send you notices by that side, believing that I will trouble you little, due to the brevity with which I have to execute what I intend; and finally, I beg you, in the name of the homeland, not to risk these people nor obstruct my well-planned plan. Lima is still at Almeida and works to arm the blacks, having already ordered that the 70 who work at the fort be employed in them if your landing occurs. Today the redoubt in front of the Pelotas bar was razed, and in the city 400 lances are being prepared, I suppose for the blacks; what a disaster!!! You shall give no one to read this warning, because some deserter may still upset everything.\n\nAugust 21, 1836.\n\nThis should have gone yesterday, and after being closed it was necessary to open it to add that the German, who was sent from there, was arrested this morning and gave account of the commission he came on: I do not know the fate this unfortunate man will have. He said he came to pump and seduce his compatriots; and the proposal to be made to them was to switch to the legality party, for which they would earn 4$ of gratification, 500 rs. daily, the value of Rio Grande. See, Senhor Pelotas. In view of all this, for the last time I ask you to withdraw as soon as possible, leaving the launch in the indicated place, and this precisely because my plan is so advanced that it is no longer possible to retreat, so you may daily receive the news I have to give. Do not delay the response to receiving this for a single moment, because where I am awaiting I may be discovered and seized.\n\nDay 23 — Nothing extraordinary has occurred today, and they only tell me that the German who was arrested, belonging to that schooner, declared that also with him came a young man named José Manuel da Silveira, who departed to the city to obtain news and communications from the legalists to carry them on board; countless squads went out to arrest him and it is impossible he escapes. Notice, Senhor José Manuel, and a Portuguese clerk of Luís Miller. Harsh treatment was given to them, and ignoring what they might have deposited, I know, however, that the first is in chains and the second with a post in the infantry, the German going to Neto’s division, as his stay here is dangerous; and who knows what fate they will give him? It is certain that Neto flees toward the direction of Bagé fleeing from Silva, who closely pursues him; but this is covered with the greatest caution. A party of both fought and Neto’s was completely destroyed. There were 27 mortal wounds, however they are healed under guard, and no one knows to whom they belong, although it is clear by the secrecy with which they are treated, etc., etc. Everything is mysterious here today: 400 horses that arrived some time ago and went to Crescêncio, some say they came sent by Manuel Gonçalves da Silva, and others by Captain Teixeira; yet the downfall of the wicked approaches, their paleness and discouragement announce it thus. The 400 lances are ready and the recruitment of blacks is openly spoken of. Nothing is known of Bento Gonçalves, and it is therefore presumable the fate that the devil designs for him. These are the news I can transmit to you up to today, the 29th, at eight in the morning, and I live in the greatest torment for not knowing if you were delivered what I sent you: God help me! Nevertheless, as fear and homeland fight in my heart, the execution of my plan marches in great strides, and it would be concluded if the presence of this force did not put the wicked in such caution. I do not detail my work for fear that this may be seized and I be discovered; but be satisfied knowing that the Germans are almost on our side; the others remain for a moment of carelessness; so I ask you to withdraw for the good of this dear homeland. I demand that all my communications be religiously kept for my defense at all times, appearing to commit crimes when I perhaps work more than I wish to show it at all times. At this moment, half past eight, thanks to heaven I have the comfort of receiving what you sent me in response to mine. We can already coordinate, already one same aim Senhor Neto, whom I consider certain because he is in perfect disregard, as it is said: he escaped on foot inside the fence of old Pires’ plantations near Veleda; however, his followers spied as many crimes as may be supposed, for not one came here to give notice. Sweats, rage, fear, etc., etc., is what I see. Finally, the tutelary genius of Brazil is with us. Whatever happens until night I will tell you. Send me as soon as possible 5 or 6 proclamations of our President, written by hand, in which forgiveness of the past is promised, except the exceptions you judge convenient. And if there is anyone authorized to do so there, all the better, given the speed and disposition in which I have put things, etc., etc. Printed proclamations set the matters to the third party and I tremble only with that license. This was opened to put this article.\n\nSir, on the 29th of last month I sent you my last communication, until today, 8th of this month of September, it has not appeared. I do not know what idea you have formed of this event, whether the black man died or escaped; but the publication of a fact I announced, and because of which I saw myself forced to hide for three days, makes me suppose my warning was delivered, and that if the black man was lost it was on return; however, having warning of vessels at the Barra yesterday and today I dare to send this one, not only to say what has happened but also to urge you to withdraw as soon as possible and appear without fail on the night of the 20th at that Barra, a time whose presence is indispensable, and not now, when again everything has been upset. Things are arranged for the night of the 20th, in the midst of the great festivity that will be held at the fort, and there is no way to fail, except if you continue to remain there; because there are warnings from Rio Grande that a landing is planned, and this was already considered certain yesterday with the arrival of 10 vessels, which made everything move at a snail’s pace. Send me the proclamations I so requested, and rest assured that the result cannot fail! Send me word if indeed Itapuã was taken or evacuated as they say, etc., etc. Silva Tavares, Mazarredo, and Calderon are in Piraí, near Bagé, waiting for Fructo Rivera who is coming to join them, which has given these friends trouble, etc., etc.\n\nNews from the Eastern State, from Neto, and from Crescêncio, have ceased, and nothing is said of Bento Gonçalves. It is suspected there is an arsenal, in clothing manufacturing, bullets, etc., and all conspires for my end. The sick people I told you about came from Neto, but from the party that had fought. Nothing more occurring, I conclude this to dispatch the courier.\n\nNota Bene On the right margin of page 1v.\n\nUnsigned; copy probably attributed to Domingos José de Almeida."
