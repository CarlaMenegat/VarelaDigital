  "translation": "Copy — To the Illustrious Sir\n\nCommitted, as you are, Lord São Gonçalo, to the triumph of legality, I venture this to inform you that an attempt has been discovered to attack the forces stationed here, and consequently ambushes are being set to surprise and destroy the force intended for that purpose. The fort is garrisoned with 250 infantrymen, 40 artillerymen, 80 horsemen, and 10 pieces [of artillery]. Besides this force, a squadron of 30 to 40 men at the Pelotas farm covers the left of the fort, located to the left of the river of the same name; at dusk 100 infantrymen leave the fort and spend the night near that farm, bringing two pieces of 9 and 6 that they took from Junqueira’s schooner, and remain there with pairs to assist at the landing point. It is decided that at the outbreak of fire in any of these parts, 40 infantrymen, who police the city, will cross the Negros pass to garrison on the Assunção side, and united they will defend the chain hastily placed in the river; these infantrymen are almost all mulattoes and blacks from the city, who with the escort of 15 horsemen from the other side of Assunção must rush to that point. Right now a squadron of 86 soldiers has just returned, that going through Canguçu towards Neto’s division turned back because the latter followed Silva Tavares, who fled in the direction of Bagé; the squadron went to spend the night at Retiro, I suppose, not only to cover the point it will occupy while going otherwise to Pelotas, but also to spare the horses’ swimming, which they can hardly manage. Neto’s brigade was reinforced with 130 men from the Estado Oriental under Lieutenant Bernardino Gomes, bringing 800 fat horses. In the report of this gathering, it is added that Paulino Fontoura crossed the Uruguay with 300 and some men from Entre Ríos and Corrientes; orders were given to unite with Neto as well. At the same time, the famous Lavalleja entered to assist Oribe with 700 men, said to be from those same places. Oribe, in a letter whose date I ignore, says that between this Province and that State the lines will be common so that those here can pass against the unfortunate emigrants, and those there against the Fructistas; for this reason, immense parties have hastily gone out collecting horses from the unfortunate emigrants, and 170 of those horses are at the Negros pass, sent by the Seráfico, an improvised ensign from the Chuí frontier. Two pieces of 36 and 24 that were at Cebolati, by Major Julian Calderon’s order were sent to the Liscano pass, and from there, Rio Grande, 35 imaginary accomplices of a rebellion, I believe to plunder, as they plundered their houses, and unfortunately they found 63 infantry weapons, pistols, swords, and more than 15 arrobas of gunpowder. The small escort accompanying these victims of rapacity was commanded by Pedro Pinto; Joaquim Marques escaped by hiding, and God willing he won't be caught, for diligences multiply, as those to foil any landing; in view of which I beg you to desist from that enterprise, withdrawing already, to see if with the disappearance of those vessels relaxation is reborn, and I carry out the plan to buy the soldiers to imprison the officers, for which I have already spent quite a lot and will not spare any sum; but everything is stalled with the arrival of that force, which could not have come at a worse time, because of the precautions and activity in which things are found. The loyalty of my intentions and services already forwarded in advance moved me to give you this warning even under the risk you can imagine, and the purity of my feelings is such that I do not even demand a reply, except if you deem it necessary. A barge should be left at the tip of Sarangonha opposite Torotama, so I can communicate whatever happens and so it does not move from there, to avoid being noticed by canoes that come and go to Rio Grande, Estreito, etc., etc., and new precautions can be taken. Every day I will send you notices from that side, believing that I will trouble you little, due to the brevity with which I have to carry out what I plan; and finally I beg you, in the name of the homeland, not to risk these men nor obstruct my well-planned scheme. Lima is still at Almeida and works to arm the blacks, having already ordered that the 70 who work in the fort be employed in this in case your landing is verified. Today the redoubt in front of the Pelotas bar was razed, and in the city 400 lances are being prepared, I suppose for the blacks; what a disaster! To no one shall you allow reading this notice, for any deserter may still upset everything.\n\nAugust 21, 1836.\n\nThis should have been sent yesterday, and after closing it was necessary to open it to add that the German, who was sent there, was arrested this morning and gave account of the commission he carried: I do not know the fate of this unhappy man. He said he came to stir up and seduce his countrymen; and the proposal to make them was to join the legality party, for which they would gain 4$ of reward, 500 rs. daily, the value of Rio Grande. See, Lord Pelotas. In view of all this, for the last time I ask you to withdraw as soon as possible, leaving the barge in the indicated place, and this only because my plan is so advanced that it is no longer possible to retreat, so you may receive daily the news I have to give. Do not delay even a moment in replying to confirm receipt of this, for where I wait I may be discovered and caught.\n\nDay 23 — Nothing extraordinary has occurred today, and they only tell me that the German who was arrested, belonging to that schooner, declared that with him there was also a young man named José Manuel da Silveira, who left for the city to obtain news and communications of the legalists to take them on board; countless patrols have gone out to arrest him and it is impossible that he escapes. Observe, Lord, Senhor José Manuel is a Portuguese clerk of Luís Miller. Harsh treatment was given to them, and ignoring what they might have testified, I know however that the first is in irons and the second with a position in the infantry, the German going to Neto’s division, as his presence there is dangerous; and who knows the fate they will give him? There is every certainty that Neto is heading towards Bagé fleeing from Silva, who closely pursues him; but this is kept under great caution. A party of both fought and Neto’s was completely destroyed. There were 27 seriously wounded, though they are cared for under guard, and no one knows to whom they belong, although it is clear by the secrecy with which they are treated, etc., etc. Today everything is mysterious here: 400 horses that arrived recently and went to Crescêncio, some say they were sent by Manuel Gonçalves da Silva, others by Captain Teixeira; nevertheless the fall of the wicked approaches, their pallor and discouragement announce it thus. The 400 lances are ready and the recruitment of blacks is spoken of openly. Nothing is known of Bento Gonçalves, and this is why one presumes the fate the devil has prepared for him. These are the news I can transmit to you until today, the 29th, at eight in the morning, and I live in great torment for not knowing if you received what I sent you: God help me! Nonetheless, although fear and the homeland struggle in my heart, the execution of my plan advances rapidly, and it would be concluded if not for the presence of that force making the wicked so cautious. I do not detail my works for fear this be seized and I discovered; but be content to know that the Germans are almost on our side; [the others remain?] for the moment of inattention; therefore I ask you to withdraw for the good of this beloved homeland. I demand that all my communications be religiously kept for my defense at all times, despite apparently being criminal when I perhaps work more than I wish to show it at all times. At this moment, half-past eight, thanks to heaven I have the comfort of receiving your reply to mine. We can already arrange, now a common goal, Lord Neto, whom I consider very certain for being in perfect neglect, as is said: he fled on foot within the fence of the old Pires’ fields near Veleda; however, his followers committed so many crimes as can be supposed, since not one came here to report. Sweats, rage, fear, etc., etc., is what I see. In short, Brazil’s tutelary genius is with us. I will tell you what happens until night. Send me as soon as possible 5 or 6 proclamations of our President, handwritten, promising forgiveness of the past, except for exceptions you consider convenient. And if there is someone there authorized for that, so much the better, due to the speed and disposition I have put things, etc., etc. Printed proclamations put matters in third place, and I tremble just with that license. This was opened to add this article.\n\nSir, on the 29th of last month I sent you my last communication; as of today, the 8th of this current September, nothing has appeared. I do not know what idea you formed of this event, whether the black man died or fled; but the publication of a fact announced by me, for which I had to hide for three days, makes me suppose that my warning was delivered, and that if the black man was lost it would be on return; however, having warning of vessels in the Barra yesterday and today, I encourage myself to send this present, not only to say what has happened, but also to urge you to withdraw as soon as possible and present yourself without fail on the night of the 20th at that Barra, time indispensable for your presence, and not now, for again everything has been upset. Things are arranged for the night of the 20th, in the midst of the great celebration that will be held at the fort, and there is no way to fail, except if you continue to stay there; because there are warnings from Rio Grande that a landing is planned, and yesterday this was judged certain with the arrival of 10 vessels, which made everything proceed at a dog’s pace. Send me the proclamations I requested so much, and rest assured that the outcome cannot fail! Have me told if Itapuã was indeed taken, or if it was evacuated as they say, etc., etc. Silva Tavares, Mazarredo and Calderon are at Piraí, near Bagé, awaiting Fructo Rivera who is coming to join them, which has kept these friends busy, etc., etc.\n\nNews from Estado Oriental, from Neto and Crescêncio have stopped, and nothing is said of Bento Gonçalves. It is thought there is an arsenal, in clothing making, bullets, etc., and everything conspires to my end. The sick I told you of came from Neto, but from the party that had fought. Nothing else occurring I conclude this present to dispatch the messenger himself.\n\nNota Bene On the right margin of leaf 1v.\n\nUnsigned; copy likely attributed to Domingos José de Almeida."
