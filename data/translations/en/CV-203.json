  "translation": "Engaged as you are, Lord São Gonçalo, in the triumph of legality, I venture this to inform you that an attempt to attack the forces stationed here has been discovered, and as a consequence, ambushes are being set to surprise and destroy the force designated for that purpose. The fort is guarded by 250 infantry, 40 artillerymen, 80 cavalry, and 10 pieces. In addition to this force, a squadron of 30 to 40 men at the Pelotas estate covers the left side of the fort, located to the left of the river of the same name; at dusk, 100 infantrymen leave the fort and spend the night in the vicinity of that estate, taking the two pieces of 9 and 6 they took from the schooner of Junqueira, and there persist with pairs to respond to the landing point. It is determined that when the firing breaks out in any of these parts, 40 infantrymen, who patrol the city, will cross the Negro Pass to secure the Assunção side and together defend the barrier hastily erected in the river; these infantry are mostly mulattoes and blacks from the city, who with the escort of 15 mounted men on the other side of the Assunção must hurry to that point. Just now, a squadron of 86 men returns, which had gone through Canguçu to Neto’s division but returned because it had followed Silva Tavares, who fled towards Bagé; the squadron probably passed through Retiro, not only to cover the point they will occupy while going to Pelotas but also to spare the swimming of the horses that can barely manage it. Neto's brigade has been reinforced with 130 men coming from the Eastern State under the command of Lieutenant Bernardino Gomes, bringing 800 stout horses. In the report of this meeting, it is added that Paulino Fontoura crossed the Uruguay with over 300 Entre Rios and Corrientes men; it was ordered that he also join Neto. At the same time, the famous Lavalleja entered to assist Oribe with 700 men, said to be from those same places. Oribe, in an official communication whose date I do not know, says that between this Province and that State, the lines will be common so that those from here may go against the unfortunate emigrants, and those from there against the fructistas; for such reason, immense parties have hurriedly gone out to collect horses from the unfortunate emigrants, and of them, 170 horses are at the Negro Pass, sent by Seráfico, an improvised ensign from the Chuí frontier. Two pieces of 36 and 24 that were in Cebolati, ordered by Major Julian Calderon, were sent to the Liscano pass, and from there, 35 imaginary accomplices of a rebellion were seized, I believe, to loot, as they looted their homes, and unfortunately found 63 infantry weapons, pistols, swords, and over 15 arrobas of gunpowder. The small escort that accompanied these victims of greed was commanded by Pedro Pinto; Joaquim Marques escaped by hiding, and God allow he does not get caught, as the efforts multiply, like those to thwart any landing; wherefore I implore you to abandon this enterprise, withdrawing now, to see if with the disappearance of these vessels relaxes and I can carry out the plan to buy soldiers with the aim of capturing the officers, for which I have already spent considerably and will not spare any amount; but everything is at a standstill with the arrival of this force, which could not have come at a worse time, given the precautions and activity in which things find themselves. The loyalty of my intentions and services already advanced moved me to give you this warning even at the risk you can imagine, and the purity of my feelings is such that I do not even require a response, unless you deem it necessary. A longboat should remain at the point of Sarangonha in front of Torotama, for me to communicate what is occurring and that it does not depart, so as not to be perceived by the canoes that come and go to Rio Grande, Estreito, etc., etc., and to take new precautions. Every day I will send you warnings from that side, believing that I will hardly mortify you, due to the brevity with which I must implement what I have planned; and lastly, I beseech you, in the name of the homeland, not to risk those people nor obstruct my well-planned scheme. Lima is still at Almeida and is working to arm the blacks, having already given an order that the 70 who work at the fort be employed in them should your landing occur. Today the redoubt in front of the Pelotas bar has been razed, and in the city, 400 lances are being prepared, I suppose for the blacks; what a disgrace!!! Do not let anyone read this warning, for some deserter might still cause everything to overturn.\n\nThis was to have been sent yesterday, and after it was sealed, it was necessary to open it to add that the German, who was sent from there, was arrested this morning, and reported on the commission he had come for: I do not know what fate this unfortunate will meet. He said he came to pump and seduce his countrymen; and the proposal to make to them was to join the party of legality, for which they would earn 4$ in bonuses, and 500 rs. daily, the value of Rio Grande. See, Lord Pelotas. In light of all this, for the last time I ask you to withdraw as soon as possible, leaving the longboat in the indicated place, and this also because my plan is so advanced that it is no longer possible to go back, in order to receive daily the news I have to give. Do not delay the response to this for a single moment, for where I am waiting I may be discovered and caught.\n\nDay 23 — Nothing extraordinary has occurred today, and all I am told is that the German who was arrested, belonging to that schooner, declared that there had also come with him a young man named José Manuel da Silveira, who went to the city to obtain news and communications from the legalists to bring them on board; numerous escorts have gone out to capture him, and it is impossible for him to escape. Be aware, Sir, that José Manuel and a Portuguese clerk of Luís Miller. Strong treatments were given to them, and not knowing what they might depose, I know yet that the first is in irons and the 2nd with troops in the infantry, while the German is going to Neto’s division, as his stay here is dangerous; and who knows what fate they will give him? There is every certainty that Neto is fleeing towards Bagé from Silva, who closely pursues him; but this is hidden with the utmost caution. A party of both fought, and Neto's was completely destroyed. They reached 27 wounded mortally, however they are being treated under guard, and no one knows to whom they belong, although it is clear by the reticence with which they are treated, etc., etc. Mysterious are all things here today: 400 horses that recently arrived and went to Crescêncio, some say sent by Manuel Gonçalves da Silva, and others by Captain Teixeira; nonetheless the fall of the wicked approaches, their pallor and dismay announce it. The 400 lances are ready, and the recruitment of blacks is being spoken of openly. From Bento Gonçalves, nothing is known, and therefore it is presumed the end the devil intends for him. These are the news I can transmit to you until today, the 29th, by eight in the morning, and I live in great torment for not knowing if you received the one I sent you: God help me! While danger and the homeland struggle in my heart, the execution of my plan moves rapidly, and it would be completed if the presence of this force did not put the wicked on such precautions. I do not detail my works for fear this might be seized and I be discovered; but suffice it to know that the Germans are almost on our side; the others remain for the moment of carelessness; for which I ask you to withdraw for the good of this dear homeland. All my communications I demand be religiously safeguarded for my defense at all times, as I appear to commit crimes when I might be laboring more than I desire to show. At this moment, eight-thirty, thank heavens I have the comfort of receiving the response you directed to me. We can now coordinate; we already have the same aim, Lord Neto, which I consider certain as he is in perfect carelessness, according to reports: he escaped on foot within the enclosed fields of the old Pires near Veleda; however, his followers spied many offenses as might be supposed, for not a single one came by here to inform. Sweats, rage, fear, etc., etc., is what I see. Finally, the tutelary spirit of Brazil is with us. Whatever occurs by night I will tell you. Send me as soon as possible 5 or 6 proclamations from our President, handwritten, in which past forgiveness is promised, except for the exceptions deemed appropriate. And if there is someone there who is authorized for that, so much the better, for the brevity and arrangement in which I have set things, etc., etc. The printed proclamations entrust affairs to a 3rd party, and I tremble just with that license. This was opened to include this article.\n\nSir, on the 29th of this month, I sent you my last communication; until today, September 8, it has not appeared. I do not know what idea formed about this event, whether the black died or fled; but the publication of a fact I announced, for which I found myself in the necessity to hide for three days, leads me to suppose that my warning was delivered, and that if the black was lost, it would be on the return; however, having a warning of vessels at the Bar yesterday and today, I am encouraged to send the present, not only to inform you of what has occurred but also to urge that you withdraw as soon as possible and present yourself without fail on the night of the 20th at that Bar, as it is indispensable for your presence at that time, and not now, which has again unsettled everything. Things are arranged for the night of the 20th, right in the midst of the great celebration that will be held at the fort, and there is no way to fail, unless you continue to remain there; for there are warnings from Rio Grande that a landing is projected, and this was already thought certain with the arrival of 10 vessels, which made everything move at a snail's pace. Send me the proclamations I have requested so much, and be assured that the result cannot fail! Let me know if Itapuã was indeed taken, or if it was evacuated as they say, etc., etc. Silva Tavares, Mazarredo, and Calderon are at Piraí, near Bagé, waiting for Fructo Rivera to join them, which has given these friends some trouble, etc., etc.\n\nThe news from the Eastern State, from Neto and from Crescêncio, has stopped and nothing is said about Bento Gonçalves. An arsenal is being worked on, manufacturing clothing, bullets, etc., and everything conspires for my end. The sick that I mentioned to you arrived from Neto, but from the party that had been defeated. No more occurrences, I conclude the present to dispatch it. \n\nNota Bene"
