  "translation": "Copy — Most Illustrious Sir\n\nEngaged as you are, Senhor São Gonçalo, in the triumph of legality, I venture this to inform you that it has been discovered that there is an attempt to attack the forces stationed here, and consequently ambushes are being made to surprise and destroy the force destined for that purpose. The fort is garrisoned with 250 infantrymen, 40 artillerymen, 80 horsemen, and 10 pieces. Besides this force, a squadron of 30 to 40 men at the Pelotas farm covers the left of the fort, located to the left of the river of the same name; at dusk 100 infantrymen leave the fort and spend the night near that farm, carrying two pieces of 9 and 6 taken from Junqueira's schooner, and remain there with patrols to assist at the landing point. It is determined that upon the outbreak of fire in any of these parts, 40 infantrymen who police the city cross the Passo dos Negros to garrison the side of Assunção, and united they defend the chain hastily placed in the river; these infantrymen are almost all mulattoes and blacks from the city, who, with the escort of 15 horsemen from the other side of Assunção, must assist at that point. A squadron of 86 soldiers just returned, which going through Canguçu to Neto’s division returned because he had followed Silva Tavares, who fled in the direction of Bagé; the squadron went to spend the night at Retiro, I suppose not only to cover the point it was to occupy while going to Pelotas but also to spare the horses that can barely endure the swimming. Neto's brigade was reinforced with 130 men from the Eastern State under the command of Lieutenant Bernardino Gomes, bringing 800 fat horses. In the report of this meeting, add that Paulino Fontoura crossed the Uruguay with 300 and some men from Entre Ríos and Corrientes; the order was also to join Neto. At the same time, the famous Lavalleja entered to assist Oribe with 700 men, they say from those same places. Oribe, in a letter whose date I ignore, says that between this Province and that State the lines will be common so that those here may pass against the unfortunate emigrants, and those there against the fructists; for this reason, vast parties have hurriedly gone out rounding up horses of the unfortunate emigrants, and 170 of these horses are at Passo dos Negros, sent by the Seráfico, an improvised ensign of the Chuí frontier. Two pieces of 36 and 24 that were in Cebolati, under Major Julián Calderon, were sent to Passo do Liscano, and from there, Rio Grande 35 imaginary accomplices of a rebellion, I believe to loot, as they looted their houses, and unfortunately 63 infantry weapons, pistols, swords, and more than 15 arrobas of gunpowder were found. The small escort that accompanied these victims of rapacity was commanded by Pedro Pinto; Joaquim Marques escaped by hiding, and may God permit he is not caught, as efforts multiply, as those to prevent any landing; therefore, I beg you to abandon that enterprise, withdrawing already, to see if with the disappearance of those vessels relaxation is reborn and I carry out the plan to buy the soldiers with the aim of arresting the officers, for which I have already spent considerably and will not spare any amount; but everything is stalled with the arrival of that force, which could not have come at a worse time, given the precautions and activity of the circumstances. The loyalty of my intentions and services already advanced beforehand moved me to give you this warning under the very risk you can imagine, and the purity of my feelings is such that I do not even require a response unless you deem it necessary. A launch should remain at the tip of Sarangonha opposite Torotama, so I can communicate whatever occurs and that it does not move from there, to avoid being detected by the canoes that come and go to Rio Grande, Estreito, etc., etc., so that new precautions are taken. Every day I will send you warnings from that side, believing I will little distress you due to the brevity with which I must carry out what I plan; and finally, I beg you, in the name of the fatherland, not to risk those men nor obstruct my well-conceived plan. Lima is still at Almeida and is working to arm the blacks, having already ordered that the 70 who work at the fort be employed in them if your landing occurs. Today the redoubt opposite the Pelotas bar was demolished, and in the city 400 lances are being prepared, I suppose for the blacks; what a misfortune!!! You must not let anyone read this warning, because some deserter may still upset everything.\n\nAugust 21, 1836.\n\nThis was supposed to be sent yesterday, and after it was closed, it was necessary to open it to add that the German, who was sent there, was arrested this morning, and he reported on the commission he was on: I do not know what fate this unfortunate will have. He said he came to pressure and seduce his compatriots; and the proposal to make to them was to side with the party of legality, for which they would gain a gratuity of 4$ and 500 rs. daily, the value of Rio Grande. See, Senhor Pelotas. In view of all this, for the last time, I ask you to withdraw as soon as possible, leaving the launch at the indicated place, and this precisely because my plan is so advanced that it is no longer possible to retreat, in order for you to receive daily the news I have to give. Do not delay a single moment the reply to the receipt of this, because where I await I may be discovered and seized.\n\nDay 23 — Nothing extraordinary has happened today, and they only tell me that the German who was arrested, belonging to that schooner, declared that there was also a young man named José Manuel da Silveira with him, who had left for the city to obtain news and communications from the legalists to take back aboard; countless patrols went out to arrest him and it is impossible that he escapes. Notice, Senhor José Manuel and a Portuguese clerk named Luís Miller. Harsh treatment was given to them, and ignoring what they might have testified, I know however that the former is in irons and the second with a post in the infantry, the German going to Neto’s division, as his stay here was dangerous; and who knows the fate they will give him? There is every certainty that Neto is fleeing in the direction of Bagé, escaping Silva, who closely pursues him; but this is concealed with the utmost caution. A detachment of both clashed and Neto’s was completely destroyed. They arrived at 27 with six mortally wounded, but they are cared for under sentinel, and no one knows to whom they belong, although it is clear by how discreetly they are treated, etc., etc. Mysterious are all things here today: 400 horses that recently arrived and were sent to Crescêncio, some say came sent by Manuel Gonçalves da Silva, and others by Captain Teixeira; however, the fall of the wicked approaches, their pallor and discouragement announce it thus. The 400 lances are ready, and the recruitment of blacks is plainly spoken of. Nothing is known of Bento Gonçalves, and it is therefore to be presumed what fate the devil has destined him. These are the news I can transmit to you up to today, the 29th, at eight in the morning, and I live in the greatest torment because I do not know if the one I sent to you was delivered: God help me! Yet, as fear and homeland fight in my heart, the execution of my plan marches rapidly, and it would be completed if not for the presence of that force that puts the wicked on such alert. I do not detail my work for fear that this be seized and I discovered; but be content knowing that the Germans are almost on our side; the others remain for the moment of inattention; for which I beg you to withdraw for the good of this beloved country. I require that all my communications be religiously kept for my defense at all times, apparently committing crimes when I work perhaps more than I desire to always show it. At this moment, eight-thirty, thanks to heaven I have the comfort of receiving the one you sent me in response to mine. We can already arrange, already one same goal Senhor Neto, whom I believe very certain for being in perfect neglect, as is told: he escaped on foot within the old Pires farm enclosure near Veleda; yet his followers committed many offenses as can be supposed, since not one came here. Sweats, fury, fear, etc., etc., are what I see. Finally, the tutelary genius of Brazil is with us. Whatever happens until night I will tell you. Send me as soon as possible 5 or 6 proclamations of our President, written by hand, in which forgiveness of the past is promised, except for the exceptions you deem convenient. And if there is anyone authorized to do that there, all the better, given the brevity and arrangement with which I have put things, etc., etc. The printed proclamations delay matters to a third party, and I tremble just with that license. This was opened to add this article.\n\nSir, on the 29th of the past month I sent you my last communication; until today, the 8th of this September, it has not appeared. I do not know what idea you might form of this event—whether the black man died or fled; but the publication of a fact I announced, for which I was forced to hide for three days, makes me suppose my warning was delivered, and that if the black man was lost it was on the return; yet, having news of vessels at the Barra yesterday and today, I dare to send this letter, not only to say what has occurred but also to urge you to withdraw as soon as possible and present yourself without fail on the night of the 20th at that Barra, a time when your presence is indispensable, and not now, when everything has once again been upset. Things are disposed for the night of the 20th, right in the middle of the great festivity that will be held at the fort, and there is no way to fail, except if you continue to remain there; because there are warnings from Rio Grande that a landing is being planned, and this was yesterday already considered certain with the arrival of 10 vessels, which made everything proceed very slowly. Send me the proclamations I have so much requested, and rest assured that the result cannot fail! Let me know if Itapuã was indeed taken or if it was evacuated as they say, etc., etc. Silva Tavares, Mazarredo, and Calderon are in Piraí, near Bagé, awaiting Fructo Rivera who is coming to join them, which has kept these friends busy, etc., etc.\n\nThe news from the Eastern State, from Neto and Crescêncio, have stopped, and nothing is said about Bento Gonçalves. An arsenal is being prepared, with clothing, bullets, etc., and everything conspires for my end. The sick I told you about came from Neto, from the detachment that had fought. Nothing more happening, I conclude this letter to dispatch it.\n\nNota Bene On the right margin of page 1v.\n\nUnsigned; copy probably attributed to Domingos José de Almeida."
