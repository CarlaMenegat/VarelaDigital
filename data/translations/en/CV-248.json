  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, August 22, 1838.\n\nYesterday almost at night I received yours and the gift you sent me with it, for which our students leaped with joy, as did I upon knowing that you and our children were well, whom you will embrace for me, telling Bruto that I do not send him raisins because there are none. Yesterday I wrote to you through Roberto and confirm what I told you, for I cannot, with the service and with longing for you.\n\nDamasceno promised to send the flour and wheat; that item here is at 8$ the alqueire, but I expect some from Rio Pardo and will send it to you immediately upon arrival.\n\nSuddenly I will be there to give you rib-breaking hugs, and farewell. Yours, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bom Retiro."
