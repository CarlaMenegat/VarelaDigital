  "translation": "Yesterday, almost at night, I received your letter and the gift you sent with it, for which our students jumped for joy, as did I, knowing that you are well and our children, whom you will embrace for me, telling Bruto that I do not send raisins because there are none. I wrote to you yesterday through Roberto and I confirm what I told you, for I cannot cope with the work and with my longing for you.\n\nDamasceno was supposed to send the flour and wheat; that item here is at 8$ per alqueire, however, I hope to get some from Rio Pardo and I will send it to you immediately when it arrives."
