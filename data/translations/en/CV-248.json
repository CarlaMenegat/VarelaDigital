  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, August 22, 1838.\n\nYesterday, near night, I received yours and the gift you sent me with it, for which our students jumped with joy, as did I for knowing that you were in good health as well as our children, whom you will embrace for me, telling Bruto that I do not send him raisins because there are none. Yesterday I wrote to you through Roberto and I confirm what I told you, for I cannot because of the work and my longing for you.\n\nDamasceno promised to send the flour and wheat; that item is here at 8$ the alqueire, but I expect some from Rio Pardo and will send it to you immediately upon arrival.\n\nSuddenly, you will have me there giving you rib-breaking hugs, and farewell. Yours, Almeida.\n\nMadam Bom Retiro."
