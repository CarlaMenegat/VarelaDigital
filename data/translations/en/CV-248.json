  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, August 22, 1838.\n\nYesterday, almost at night, I received yours and the gift you sent me with it, for which our students jumped with joy, as did I upon knowing that you and our children were well, whom you will embrace for me, telling Bruto that I do not send him raisins because there are none. Yesterday I wrote to you by Roberto and I confirm what I told you, for I cannot with the work and with missing you.\n\nDamasceno promised to send the flour and wheat; that item here is at 8$ the alqueire, but I expect some from Rio Pardo and will send it to you immediately upon its arrival.\n\nSuddenly, you will have me there hugging you tightly, and farewell. Yours, Almeida.\n\nSenhora Bom Retiro."
