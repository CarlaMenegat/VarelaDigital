  "translation": "In light of the documents attached, which cost us quite a bit to gather, you will see what is happening around here; it is useless for us to elaborate on the contentment and joy of all these people when they received the letters from General Bento Manuel: there were illuminations in 15 or 16 houses, fireworks, etc.; today a grand dinner at B.R.B.'s house in thanksgiving for the good arrival of Major Melo: in short, little by little, everyone is coming together perhaps to devise new plans; what is certain is that, the Lord, Colonel Bento Gonçalves is in the same camp, as this latter is the head of S...., etc. and other pleasant epithets. The Chamber met extraordinarily yesterday to open the aforementioned letters, but for now, they did not make them public.\n\nAfter all, you all (in the opinion of these people) are the ones instigating the proclamation of the Republic: however, they want it this way because they have nothing to lose, and other endless invectives. Your friend Doctor João had the imprudence to say, in the presence of several people, and even the Lord, that he hoped to see that when some returned home, they would find their belongings out in the open. In short, they speak with a fervor that is enjoyable. All this is quite tedious, but let it serve as governance for you. Believe me, they have few sincere friends left here.\n\nI ask you not to return until you see that it is completely safe to do so.\n\nAccording to what they say, Crescêncio and Neto are steadfast."
