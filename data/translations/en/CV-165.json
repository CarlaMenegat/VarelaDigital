  "translation": "In view of the enclosed documents, which cost us quite a lot to obtain, you will see what is happening here; it is useless to be extensive in expressing to you the satisfaction and joy of all these people when they received the official letters from General Bento Manuel: there were illuminations in 15 or 16 houses, fireworks, etc.; today a big dinner at the house of B.R.B. in thanksgiving, and for the safe arrival of Major Melo: in short, little by little, everyone comes together to perhaps plan new schemes; what is certain is that the Lord, Colonel Bento Gonçalves, are from the same mold, that the latter is chief of S...., etc. and other pleasant epithets. The Chamber convened extraordinarily yesterday to open the said letters, but for now they have not made them public.\n\nAfter all, you all are (in the opinion of these people) those who instigate the proclamation of the Republic: but they want it so because they have nothing to lose, and other endless invectives. Your friend Doctor João had the imprudence to say, in the presence of several people, and even the Lord, that he hoped to see that when some returned to their homes, they would find their goods in the square. In short, they speak with such vigor that it is a pleasure. All this is quite tedious, but let it serve you as government. Believe that here you will have few sincere friends.\n\nI ask you not to return here unless you see that it is completely safe to do so.\n\nAccording to reports, Crescêncio and Neto are steadfast.\n\nBernardina"
