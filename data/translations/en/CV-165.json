  "translation": "In view of the documents enclosed, which cost us quite a lot to obtain, you will see what is happening here; it is useless to be lengthy in expressing to you the satisfaction and joy of all these people when they received the letters from General Bento Manuel: there were celebrations at about 15 or 16 houses, rockets, etc.; today a big dinner at the house of B.R.B. in thanksgiving, and for the safe arrival of Major Melo: finally, little by little, everyone is gathering perhaps to devise new plans; what is certain is that, Sir, Colonel Bento Gonçalves is of the same mold, that the latter is chief of S...., etc. and other agreeable epithets. The Council met extraordinarily yesterday to open the said letters, but for now they have not made them public.\n\nIn the end, you gentlemen are all (in the opinion of these people) those who instigate the proclamation of the Republic: but they want it so because they have nothing to lose, and other endless invectives. Your friend Doctor João had the imprudence to say, in the presence of several people, and even of Sir, that he hoped to see that, when some returned to their homes, they would find their goods in the square. In short, they speak with such fervor that it is a pleasure. All this is rather tiresome, but let it serve as government for you. Believe that here they have few sincere friends left.\n\nI ask you not to return here except when you see complete safety to do so.\n\nThey say that Crescêncio and Neto are steadfast.\n\nBernardina"
