  "translation": "Now, at around 5 in the afternoon, I received with great pleasure the letter you wrote to me from Pedras Brancas on the 2nd of this month, certifying your good health, which is what I care about most; except for the fact that I am always troubled by these disorders, I am living in good health, as are our children, whom I embrace on your behalf and request blessings for.\n\nAraújo Ribeiro, they say is certainly going there to take possession; he surely left today on the steamboat for Rio Grande, where despite the many advisers, just like those here, he will resolve to go, God willing, to see if we can calm down and avoid greater disorder.\n\nWhat he agreed upon with Captain Antunes, you will know better from him, and so I will not speak about it. If things take a better turn, good; however, I always believe that we should not disregard the matter you have in hand, for that is all my desire, therefore, in case peace is restored, I settle that either you should come here soon or send someone in your name to make the arrangements as you wish; count on my willingness, which is all to see you calm and free from such disturbances.\n\nUncle Boaventura, who boasts of being the one who has done the most for Araújo Ribeiro to go there to take possession, today, I mean, yesterday left with his family aboard a Luís de Azevedo.\n\nI will keep observing and listening for something new, so that at the first opportunity I can inform you. I instructed João da Cunha to write to you about the affairs of our house on this same occasion, and for that reason, I will not say anything about it. Please accept greetings from your godfather José Félix. May God grant you health and keep you as your lover wishes."
