  "translation": "My dear husband of my heart Pelotas, February 6, 1836.\n\nNow, around 5 o’clock in the afternoon, with great pleasure, I received the letter you wrote me from Pedras Brancas on the 2nd of this month, informing me of your good health, in which I am more than anything concerned; I, except for always having my spirit troubled by these disorders, live in health and our children the same way, whom I embrace on your behalf and ask for blessings.\n\nAraújo Ribeiro, they say for certain that he will take possession there; today he certainly left on the steamboat to Rio Grande, where despite the many counselors, just like those here, it will be decided that he go, may God permit it, to see if we calm down and there is no greater disorder.\n\nWhat he arranged with Captain Antunes, you will better know since he already knows it, and therefore I say nothing about it. In case things take a better form, good; but I always think that we should not disregard the business you have on hand, for that is all my desire, therefore, in case peace is reestablished, I state that you should either come here soon or send someone to make arrangements in your name as you wish; count on my will, which is all to see you calm and free from such noises.\n\nUncle Boaventura, who prides himself on being the one who most endeavored for Araújo Ribeiro to go there to take possession, today, I say, yesterday left with his family embarked on a Luís de Azevedo.\n\nI will be observing and hearing something new, to communicate to you at the first opportunity. I have instructed João da Cunha to write to you on this same occasion about the business of our house, and for that reason I say nothing in this regard. Accept regards from godfather José Félix. May God give you health and keep you as your loving\n\nBernardina\n\nMr. Domingos José de Almeida Porto Alegre."
