  "translation": "My dear husband of my heart  \nPelotas, February 6, 1836.\n\nNow, around 5 o'clock in the afternoon, with great pleasure, I received the letter you wrote me from Pedras Brancas on the 2nd of this month, to inform me of your good health, which is what I care about most of all; except for always having my spirit troubled by these disorders, I have been living in good health as have our children, whom I embrace on your behalf and ask for blessings for.\n\nAraújo Ribeiro, they say for certain, is going there to take possession; he certainly left today on the steamship to Rio Grande, where despite the many counselors, like those here, it will be decided if he will go, God willing, so that we may have peace and greater disorder may not occur.\n\nWhat he agreed with Captain Antunes, you will know better from him, and so I say nothing about it. If things take a better turn, good; but I am always of the opinion that we should not neglect the business you have in hand, for this is my entire wish, therefore, in case peace is reestablished, I insist that you either come here soon yourself, or send someone in your name to make arrangements according to your wishes; count on my will, which is entirely to see you peaceful and free from such troubles.\n\nUncle Boaventura, who boasts of being the one who most endeavored for Araújo Ribeiro to take possession there, today—I mean, yesterday—left with his family embarked on a Luís de Azevedo.\n\nI will keep observing and hearing something new to inform you on the first occasion. I have instructed João da Cunha to write to you at this same time about the business of our household, and so I say nothing more about that. Accept the regards of godfather José Félix. May God give you health and keep you as your loving  \nBernardina desires.\n\nSenhor Domingos José de Almeida  \nPorto Alegre."
