  "translation": "Friend Sir\n\nThe 158$880 can either be debited by us or received from the State on account of whoever requested it, and they are included in the latest loan to be paid from the first available funds: therefore, it is at your discretion whatever you wish. As for the account of Paulo Vicente, I do not know who he is, but if you tell me, I can then respond regarding what is required in this respect. At your disposal\n\nYour sincere very grateful friend Almeida  \nPiratini, November 10, 1838.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Carlos Fernandez de Quincoze. Your House."
