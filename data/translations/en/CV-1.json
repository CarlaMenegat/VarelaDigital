  "translation": "Friend Alfredo\n\nOnly today can I answer your letter, due to the ailing state of the veteran Coritiba with whom I needed to talk to give a proper response.\n\nWe are very sorry that the promptness with which you decided to leave prevented the promised visit by us, desired for the pleasure it would have given us. May the trip to Buenos Aires be enjoyable and may you return again to Rio Grande, these are our wishes.\n\nFrom the old Coritiba I gathered the following: “In the battle of Espinilho both were present, Canabarro and Bento Manuel, the latter had passed to the Republic only a few days before.\n\nIt was only one corps and one squadron that defeated the loyalist force. The operations were conceived by Canabarro. The corps (battalion) was commanded by Colonel Joaquim Teixeira Nunes and the squadron by Demétrio Ribeiro. In this attack the loyalist captain Roque was taken prisoner and was shot during the march. This captain General Lima, was in a house on the frontier.”\n\nHere the old man ended what he knew, saying he was ready to give more clarifications when necessary, that is, requested. I believe your esteemed letter is answered, only asking that you accept with cousin Josefina our expressions of esteem and caress the dear Vivi many times, on our behalf.\n\nI thank you for the good wishes expressed for Laia’s recovery, whom I will inform as soon as she returns from the trip she is making to a farm in the municipality.\n\nRaul Cachoeira sends hugs, 27-4-96.\n\nRaul Abbott"
