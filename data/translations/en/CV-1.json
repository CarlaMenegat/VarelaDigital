  "translation": "Only today can I answer your letter, due to the sickly state of the veteran Coritiba with whom I needed to speak in order to give a proper response.\n\nWe regret very much that the promptness with which you decided to leave prevented the promised visit from us, which we desired for the pleasure it would bring us. May the trip to Buenos Aires be pleasant, and may you return again to Rio Grande are our wishes.\n\nFrom the old Coritiba I gathered the following: “At the battle of Espinilho both were there, Canabarro and Bento Manuel, the latter having joined the Republic a few days earlier.\n\nIt was only one corps and one squadron that defeated the legal force. The operations were conceived by Canabarro. The corps (battalion) was commanded by Colonel Joaquim Teixeira Nunes and the squadron by Demétrio Ribeiro. In this attack, the loyalist captain Roque was taken prisoner and was executed by firing squad on the march. That was Captain General Lima, in a border house.”\n\nHere ends what the old man knew, saying he was ready to provide more clarifications, when necessary, that is, requested. I believe your esteemed letter has been answered, lacking only to ask you to accept, with cousin Josefina, our expressions of esteem and to caress the dear Vivi many times for us.\n\nI appreciate the good wishes expressed for Laia’s recovery, to whom I will make aware once she returns from the trip she is taking to a farm in the county."
