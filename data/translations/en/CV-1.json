  "translation": "Friend Alfredo\n\nOnly today can I respond to your letter, due to the sickly state of the veteran Coritiba with whom I needed to converse to give a proper answer.\n\nWe regret very much that the promptness with which you decided to leave prevented us from the promised visit, desired by us for the pleasure it would have brought us. May the trip to Buenos Aires be pleasant and may you return again to Rio Grande, which are our wishes.\n\nFrom the old Coritiba I gathered the following: \"In the battle of Espinilho were the two, Canabarro and Bento Manuel, the latter having passed to the Republic only a few days before.\n\nIt was merely one corps and one squadron that defeated the legal force. The operations were conceived by Canabarro. The corps (battalion) was commanded by Colonel Joaquim Teixeira Nunes and the squadron by Demétrio Ribeiro. In this attack, the legalist captain Roque was taken prisoner and was executed by firing squad during the march. That captain was General Lima, in a house at the border.”\n\nHere the old man ends what he knew, saying he is ready to provide further clarifications when necessary, that is, requested. I believe your esteemed letter is answered, only asking you to accept with cousin Josefina our expressions of esteem and to caress the sweet Vivi many times for us.\n\nI thank you for the good wishes expressed for Laia's recovery, of whom I will inform as soon as she returns from the trip she is taking to a farm in the municipality.\n\nRegards, sent by Raul  \nCachoeira, 27-4-96.\n\nRaul Abbott"
