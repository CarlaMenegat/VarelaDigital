  "translation": "Friend Alfredo\n\nOnly today can I respond to your letter, due to the ailing state of the veteran Coritiba with whom I needed to speak to give an appropriate reply.\n\nWe regret very much that the promptness with which you decided to leave prevented us from the promised visit, desired by us for the pleasure it would bring. May your trip to Buenos Aires be pleasant and may you return again to Rio Grande, these are our wishes.\n\nFrom the old Coritiba I gathered the following: “In the battle of Espinilho there were both Canabarro and Bento Manuel, the latter having recently joined the Republic.\n\nIt was only one corps and one squadron that defeated the loyalist force. The operations were conceived by Canabarro. The corps (battalion) was commanded by Colonel Joaquim Teixeira Nunes and the squadron by Demétrio Ribeiro. In this attack the loyalist captain Roque was taken prisoner and was shot while marching. That captain General Lima, was in a house on the border.”\n\nHere the old man finished what he knew, saying he was ready to provide more clarifications if necessary, I mean, if requested. I believe your esteemed letter is answered, only lacking to ask you to accept, along with cousin Josefina, our expressions of esteem and to caress the dear Vivi many times on our behalf.\n\nI thank you for the good wishes expressed for the recovery of Laia, of whom I will notify as soon as she returns from the trip she is making to a farm in the municipality.\n\nRaul Cachoeira sends embraces, 27-4-96.\n\nRaul Abbott"
