  "translation": "My dear Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida from the heart Porto Alegre, January 12, 1836.\n\nDeeply saddened by the thought of your afflictions, I still write to you despite having written yesterday. Indeed, the cloud that now covers the horizon of our Province is quite dark; but I do not despair of its salvation, if consummate prudence presiding over the acts of administration promptly dissipates the fears that the enthusiasm of a false patriotism, along with ignoble revenges, has made resurface. The response of the appointed President to the Chamber of the town of the North has caused sharp displeasures by rousing provincialism, thus inciting passions that can too much compromise the progress of affairs.\n\nI no longer go out to avoid disputes defending those expressions, although I am understood to be included in them; but even so I do not cease to bear in hurt silence the part that falls to me, very particularly when I think that this Chamber, to which such a brilliant speech was addressed, contains only two individuals who are from here. Nevertheless, despite the just bitterness that accompanies me, I am determined to close my eyes to everything and redouble efforts so that the Province may be pulled out of the abyss that threatens it: in it I have you and seven children, and this is enough for me to wish it all happiness, etc., etc. I therefore beseech you, earnestly, to disregard all that they may tell you about me and that might compromise your peace; even flee, my dearly beloved Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida, from the people who with such news will come to distress you there. Consider that we are in a crisis, and while it has not been resolved to produce its outcome, it would be a mistake to take as gospel everything that is invented, etc., etc.\n\nFarewell, embraces to all our family, and receive your sincere Almeida’s heart.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
