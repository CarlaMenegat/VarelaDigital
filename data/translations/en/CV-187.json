  "translation": "Greatly saddened by the thought of your suffering, I am still writing to you despite having written yesterday. The cloud that now covers the horizon of our Province is indeed quite dark; yet for this reason, I do not lose hope for its salvation, if a wise prudence guiding the acts of administration can quickly dispel the fears that the enthusiasm of a false patriotism, alongside ignoble revenge, has made resurface. The response of the newly appointed President to the Town Council of the North has caused bitter displeasures by stirring up provincialism, thereby inciting passions that can greatly compromise the course of affairs.\n\nI no longer go out to avoid disputes in defense of those expressions, understood as they are; but that does not prevent me from bearing my share in hurt silence, particularly when I think that this Council, to whom such a brilliant speech was addressed, has only two individuals from here. Nonetheless, despite the just bitterness that accompanies me, I am resolute in closing my eyes to everything and redoubling my efforts so that the Province may be pulled from the abyss that threatens it: there I have you and seven children, and this is enough for me to wish it all the fortunes, etc., etc. Therefore, I implore you, and earnestly request, to disregard everything that they may say about me that could compromise your peace; avoid even, my dearly beloved Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida, those people who will afflict you with such news. Consider that we are in a crisis, and that until it unfolds to yield its fruit, it would be a mistake to take seriously whatever is invented, etc., etc."
