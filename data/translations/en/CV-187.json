  "translation": "My dear Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida from the heart  \nPorto Alegre, January 12, 1836.\n\nGreatly anguished by the thought of your afflictions, I still write to you despite having done so yesterday. Indeed, the cloud that now covers the horizon of our Province is quite dark; but I do not despair of its salvation, provided that consummate prudence presides over the acts of the administration to promptly dispel the fears that the enthusiasm of a false patriotism, along with ignoble vengeance, has caused to arise again. The response of the appointed President to the Chamber of the northern town has provoked bitter displeasures by inciting provincialism, thereby stirring passions that may too greatly compromise the progress of affairs.\n\nI no longer go out to avoid disputes in defense of those expressions, although I am included in them; but I do not cease to bear with wounded silence the burden that falls upon me, particularly when I think that this Chamber, to which such a brilliant speech was addressed, confronts itself here with only two individuals originating from there. Nevertheless, despite the just bitterness that accompanies me, I am resolved to close my eyes to everything and redouble my efforts so that the Province may be snatched from the abyss that threatens it: in it I have you and seven children, and that suffices for me to wish it all happiness, etc., etc. I therefore beg you, earnestly, to disregard everything you may hear about me that might compromise your peace; even avoid, my beloved dear Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida, the people who will bring you such news to afflict you there. Consider that we are in a crisis, and until it unfolds to reveal its outcome, it will be an error to take as true anything that may be invented, etc., etc.\n\nFarewell, embraces to all of ours, and receive your sincere Almeida’s heart.\n\nMadam Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
