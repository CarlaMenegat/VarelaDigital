  "translation": "My dear godfather and friend  \nPiratini, November 20, 1841.\n\nI received your esteemed letter of the 16th of this month, accompanied by the office for Dutra, which I will deliver as soon as it is appropriate; it seems unnecessary to thank you for this favor, because there have been so many I have received that I think I must have already tired you, yet still I do not lose heart, confident in your benevolent genius and in how much you strive to be useful not only to your friends but to all humanity; I am certain to proceed to that place as soon as Your Excellency\n\nNow I have to inform you that the Galicians on the 17th of this month disembarked in Pelotas with their new General, Valente, only in name; they say they released one battalion and a small amount of cavalry; if this is peace, what will war be; finally, the peace must be like that of the nuns that Your Excellency\n\nThey say that Father Chagas is going there to reside as Pro.cor, which took a long time to resolve; many complaints about Your Excellency, Your Excellency, Your Excellency\n\nYour goddaughter sends you regards and to my esteemed godmother, I and your godmother recommend ourselves very much, as we do to D. Custodinha, Bruto and the rest of the family.\n\nBe at ease with one who has the satisfaction of being  \nOf Your Excellency,  \nAntônio José de Abreu\n\nAnswered on November 30, 1841.\n\nTo citizen Domingos José de Almeida, Bagé."
