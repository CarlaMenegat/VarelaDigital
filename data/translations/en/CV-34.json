  "translation": "My dear godfather and friend  \nPiratini, November 20, 1841.\n\nI received your esteemed letter of the 16th of this month, accompanied by the official dispatch for Dutra, which I will deliver to him as soon as it is appropriate; it seems unnecessary to thank you for this favor, because there are so many I have received that I think I may have already tired you, however, I do not discourage myself, trusting in your benevolent spirit and how much you strive to be useful not only to your friends but to all humanity; I am certain to proceed to that place as soon as Your Excellency\n\nNow I have to inform you that the \"galegos\" on the 17th of this month disembarked in Pelotas with their new General Valente, only in name; they say they released a battalion and a small portion of cavalry; if this is peace, what will war be; finally, peace must be that of the nuns that Your Excellency\n\nThey say that Father Chagas is going there to reside as Pro. cor, which cost a lot to be decided; he often complains about Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency\n\nYour goddaughter sends you a hug and to my dear godmother, I and your godmother highly recommend ourselves, as well as we do to D. Custodinha, Bruto and the rest of the family.\n\nBe frank in dealing with one who has the satisfaction of being  \nYour Excellency's  \nAntônio José de Abreu\n\nAnswered on November 30, 1841.\n\nTo citizen Domingos José de Almeida. Bagé."
