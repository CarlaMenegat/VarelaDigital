  "translation": "Piratini, November 20, 1841.\n\nI received your esteemed letter of the 16th of this month, accompanied by the office for Dutra, which I will deliver as soon as I have the opportunity; it seems unnecessary to thank you for this favor, as I have received so many that I think I might have already burdened you, yet I remain undaunted, trusting in your benevolent spirit and your efforts to be useful not only to your friends but to all of humanity; I am certain to proceed to that place as soon as Your Excellency \n\nNow I must inform you that the Galicians disembarked in Pelotas on the 17th of this month with their new General Valente, only in name; they claim to have released a battalion and a small number of cavalry; if this is peace, what would war be; in short, the peace must be that of the nuns that Your Excellency \n\nThey say that Father Chagas is going there to reside as Pro.cor, which took quite a while to resolve; he is quite complaining about Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency \n\nYour goddaughter sends you a hug and to my dear comadre, I and your comadre commend ourselves, as well as we do to D. Custodinha, Bruto, and the rest of the family.\n\nAnswered on November 30, 1841.\n\nTo the citizen Domingos José de Almeida. Bagé."
