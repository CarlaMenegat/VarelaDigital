  "translation": "Piratini, August 13, 1837, at 3 in the afternoon. Dear Bernardina\n\nAt this moment I am informed that Chaves, on the 29th of last month, coming from his charqueada to the city of Montevideo, capsized the boat and drowned along with all the people who were with him. In view of this, the blacks must not be sent under any circumstances; rather, to start covering our expenses, it is better to hand them over to Senhor Dom Júan José Victorica, because we will arrange matters with your brother afterwards. Therefore, even in the event that you have delivered the said slaves to Torquato, order him to keep them with him until an order from the said Victorica or from me follows. I can hardly express my distress over that event: he was my friend, he was virtuous, and besides all that we have very complicated accounts. From wherever you receive this, send your orders accordingly.\n\nI suppose that cousin Felizardo may have also died, because on the 23rd he wrote to me from that place, even from Chaves’s house. May God grant me patience.\n\nGreetings to our children and receive the heart of your faithful friend Almeida."
