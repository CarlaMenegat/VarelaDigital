  "translation": "At this moment, I am informed that Chaves, on the 29th of last month, coming from his charqueada to the city of Montevideo, overturned the boat and drowned with all the people who were with him. In light of this, the negros should not be followed in any way; rather, to start covering our expenses, it is better to hand them over to Sir Dom Júan José Victorica, because we will manage with your brother later. Therefore, even in the case that you have handed over the said slaves to Torquato, send word to keep them with him until orders from the said Victorica or my second. I can barely explain my distress due to that event: he was my friend, he was virtuous, and besides, we have very complicated accounts. From wherever you receive this, send your orders regarding it.\n\nI suppose that cousin Felizardo may also have died, because on the 23rd he wrote to me from that place, even from Chaves' house. God grant me patience."
