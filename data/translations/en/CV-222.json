  "translation": "Piratini, August 13, 1837, at 3 in the afternoon. Dear Bernardina\n\nAt this moment I am informed that Chaves, on the 29th of last month, coming from his charqueada to the city of Montevideo, overturned the boat and drowned along with all the people who were with him. In view of this, the black slaves must not be sent under any circumstances; rather, to start covering our expenses, it is better to deliver them to Señor Don Júan José Victorica, because with your brother we will arrange things afterwards. Therefore, even in the case that you have delivered said slaves to Torquato, order him to keep them until instructions from said Victorica or from me. I can hardly explain my anguish over that event: he was my friend, he was virtuous, and on top of that we have very complicated accounts. From wherever you receive this, send out your orders regarding this matter.\n\nI suppose that cousin Felizardo may have also died, because on the 23rd he wrote to me from that place, even from Chaves’ house. God grant me patience.\n\nRegards to our children and receive the heart of your faithful friend Almeida."
