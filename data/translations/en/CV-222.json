  "translation": "Piratini, August 13, 1837, at 3 in the afternoon. Dear Bernardina\n\nAt this moment I am informed that Chaves, on the 29th of last month, coming from his charqueada to the city of Montevideo, capsized the boat and drowned along with everyone who was with him. In light of this, the blacks must not be sent under any circumstances; rather, to begin covering our expenses, it is better to deliver them to Senhor Dom Juan José Victorica, because with your brother-in-law we will arrange matters afterward. Therefore, even in the case that you have delivered the said slaves to Torquato, order him to keep them until the order of the aforementioned Victorica or further instructions from me. I can hardly explain to you my distress because of that event: he was my friend, he was virtuous, and besides all that, we have complicated accounts. From wherever you receive this, issue your orders accordingly.\n\nI suppose that cousin Felizardo also may have died, because on the 23rd he wrote to me from that place, and even from Chaves's house. May God give me patience.\n\nRegards to our children and you receive the heart of your faithful friend Almeida."
