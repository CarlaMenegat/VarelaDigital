  "translation": "I have been passing without major news, despite great headaches yesterday and today.\n\nTomorrow I suppose our electoral work will end, and if possible I intend to return Thursday or Friday. A hug to our Mingote and Bernardino, whom I have missed very much and I wish to already embrace my Mingote.\n\nGreetings to the godmother, godfathers, and everyone in general.\n\nYour old one at heart Almeida. Rio Grande, October 21, 1828.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
