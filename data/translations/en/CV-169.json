  "translation": "I have been doing without much news, despite having great headaches yesterday and today.\n\nTomorrow I suppose our electoral work will end, and if possible I intend to return on Friday or Saturday. A hug to our Mingote and Bernardino, whom I have missed a lot and I wish I could already embrace my Mingote.\n\nRecommendations to the comadre, compadres, and everyone in general."
