  "translation": "Dear Bernardina\n\nIn my last letter I already gave you the reasons that forced me to remain at my post, despite a whimsical resistance, as you may have noticed. However, I do not give up arranging a place where you and our children can spend the rest of our days in peace, devoting myself entirely to repairing the hardships you have suffered since we married, etc., etc... I told you then, and now I repeat, that Manuel Gonçalves offered me the house that D. Caetana will vacate: there you will have his company and a tutor for our children, and besides that you will be very close to receive news from me: if that suits you, have Benito asked to accompany you and make the move whenever you think best or when you learn of D. Caetana's return.\n\nHave Torquato take to Montevidéu all the slaves listed in the attached list, in case you do not need any or some of them, because then you will leave those you need; and by the wagon send for salt, flour, rice, sugar, wine, vinegar and everything else for you and our children from Montevidéu, for I work for no one else, and I want the wagon to go for that purpose and to carry the slaves' luggage. Send that letter to Manuel Gonçalves as soon as possible, to see if he sends the 65$410 with which I supplied Lima, which may be of some use to you. Our political affairs go on without news but seem stalled.\n\nI again recommend that you send for the wagon well loaded with the goods I mentioned, because we are in winter and I do not want you and our children to suffer shortages.\n\nRegards to our relatives in general; hugs to our children and you receive the heart of Your Almeida.\n\nPiratini, May 25, 1837.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Chuí; at the house of Mr. Luís Vieira."
