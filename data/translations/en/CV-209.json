  "translation": "Dear Bernardina\n\nIn my last letter, I already gave you the reasons that compelled me to remain at my post, despite a stubborn resistance, as you may have gathered. However, I have not given up arranging a place where you and our children can spend the rest of our days in peace, dedicating myself entirely to making up for the hardships you have endured since we married, etc., etc... I told you then, and I repeat it now, that Manuel Gonçalves offered me the house that D. Caetana will vacate: there you have his company and a teacher for our children, and besides that, you will be very close to receive news from me: if that suits you, send for Benito to accompany you and make this move whenever you think fit or when you learn of D. Caetana's return.\n\nHave Torquato instructed to take to Montevideo all the slaves listed in the attached list, unless you need some of them, in which case you will leave those you require; and by the carriage have salt, flour, rice, sugar, wine, vinegar, and all else you and our children may need brought from Montevideo, for I do not work for anyone else, and I want the carriage to be used for this purpose and to carry the slaves' baggage. Send that letter to Manuel Gonçalves as soon as possible, to see if he can send the 65$410 with which I supplied Lima, which may be of some use to you. Our political affairs are progressing without news, but seem stalled.\n\nI again recommend that you have the carriage well loaded with the goods I mentioned, for we are in winter and I do not want you and our children to suffer shortages.\n\nAffection to our relatives in general; embraces to our children and you receive the heart of Your Almeida.\n\nPiratini, May 25, 1837.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Chuí; at the house of Senhor Luís Vieira."
