  "translation": "In my last message, I gave you the reasons that compelled me to stay in my position, despite a whimsical resistance, as you might have noticed. However, I do not give up on arranging a place where I can spend the rest of my days in peace with you and our children, dedicating myself entirely to making up for the disappointments you have suffered since we got married, etc., etc... I told you then, and I still repeat now, that Manuel Gonçalves offered me the house that D. Caetana will vacate: there you will have his company and guidance for our children, and besides, it will be very convenient for you to gather news about me: if that pleases you, please ask Benito to accompany you and make that move whenever it seems right to you or when you know of D. Caetana's return.\n\nPlease speak to Torquato to take to Montevideo all the slaves listed in the attached list, unless you need some or any of them, in which case you will keep the ones you need; and through the cart, have salt, flour, rice, sugar, wine, vinegar, and all else sent from Montevideo for you and our children, for I do not work for anyone else, and I want the cart to go for this purpose and to carry the luggage of the slaves. Send this letter to Manuel Gonçalves as soon as possible to see if he can send the $65.410 that I provided for Lima, which may be of some help to you. Our political affairs are proceeding without any news, but they seem stagnant.\n\nI once again recommend that you have the cart loaded with the goods I mentioned, as we are in winter, and I do not want you and our children to suffer any shortages."
