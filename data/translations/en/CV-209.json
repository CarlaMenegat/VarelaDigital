  "translation": "Dear Bernardina\n\nIn my last letter I already gave you the reasons that forced me to stay at my post, despite a stubborn resistance, as you may have noticed. However, I do not give up on arranging a place where you and our children can spend the rest of our days in peace, dedicating myself entirely to making up for the hardships you have endured since we married, etc., etc... I told you then, and I repeat it now, that Manuel Gonçalves offered me the house that D. Caetana is going to vacate: there you will have his company and a teacher for our children, and besides that you will be very close so you can gather news from me: if that suits you, ask Benito to accompany you and make the move whenever you think it best or when you learn of D. Caetana's return.\n\nHave Torquato be told to take to Montevideo all the slaves listed in the attached list, unless you need some of them, in which case you will leave those you need behind; and have salt, flour, rice, sugar, wine, vinegar, and everything else for you and our children brought by cart from Montevideo, since I work for no one else, and I want the cart to be used for this purpose and to carry the slaves' baggage. Send that letter to Manuel Gonçalves as soon as possible, to see if he sends the 65$410 with which I supplied Lima, which may be of some use to you. Our political affairs are progressing without news, but seem to be at a standstill.\n\nI again recommend that you have the cart well loaded with the goods I mentioned, since it is winter and I do not want you and our children to suffer from shortages.\n\nFond regards to our relatives in general; hugs to our children and receive the heart of Your Almeida.\n\nPiratini, May 25, 1837.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Chuí; at Mr. Luís Vieira’s house."
