  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir Bagé, February 21, 1842.\n\nWishing to contest what Your Lordship Almeida addressed to me, and which was entrusted to me by him, I directed the enclosed to the Inspector, which you will see along with his response and that of the Accountant, which certainly motivated the inability to issue an order marking the amount that, on account of what the State owes him, should be deducted; which was caused by Your Lordship the Collector, giving the bill of the amount of the dues to the Collector in the established form, and immediately sending his documents to this one to his attorney, to whom he will communicate the value of the dispatch made and in which Collectory, so that this one, attaching the said documents, may request that the amount of the said bill be found for him, which will take place, and the Treasury will issue the order to the collector.\n\nNow, for this, ample time is allowed, for the term of the said bill can never be less than 30 days, and thus the settlement Your Lordship intends is effectuated.\n\nYours, Antônio Vicente da Fontoura.\n\nPost scriptum: The demand of Alexandre Silveira is so just that if I could, on my own account, I would advance his disbursement; however, to effect it, it is also necessary that Your Lordship\n\n1842 Senhor Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu\n\nAnnexed to document CV-6."
