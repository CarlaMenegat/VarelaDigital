  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir Bagé, February 21, 1842.\n\nWanting to contest what Your Lordship Almeida addressed, and which was entrusted to me by him, I sent the enclosed to the Inspector, which you will see along with his response and that of the Accountant, which certainly explains why it was not possible to issue an order marking the amount that on account of what the State owes him should be deducted; which was caused by Your Lordship, Your Lordship of the Treasury, giving the promissory note of the amount of the duties to the Collector in the established manner, and then sending his documents to this one’s procurator, to whom the value of the dispatched amount and in which Treasury will be indicated, so that he, attaching said documents, may request that the amount of the said promissory note be found to him, which will take place, and the Treasury will issue the order to the collector.\n\nNow, this has been so for a long time, because the term of the said promissory note can never be less than 30 days, and thus the setoff that Your Lordship intends is accomplished.\n\nYours, Antônio Vicente da Fontoura.\n\nPost scriptum It is so just the demand of Alexandre Silveira that if I could, on my own account, I would advance his disbursement; however, to carry it out it is also necessary that Your Lordship\n\n1842 Senhor Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu\n\nAnnex to document CV-6."
