  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that on the 21st at 4 o'clock in the afternoon I took 80 men from my command on the steamer and 50 horses on “barca n.º1,” and around 5 o'clock in the afternoon I proceeded to the charqueadas da Barra, where I disembarked around 11 at night, immediately taking all necessary measures to avoid news spreading and to find some horses to mount the rest of the men, which I succeeded in doing; and on the 22nd around 5 in the afternoon I set out, and on the 23rd at 3 in the afternoon I surrounded the Chapel of the Sorrows under a very heavy storm, where Major Domingos Barbosa, commander of the 5th Corps of the rebels, was captured, along with a sergeant who was his brother and two soldiers; the others escaped on foot as the said chapel is located in the midst of the woods, and my soldiers, very wet from the storm, left saddles and some weapons behind.\n\nOver 50 gentle horses were recruited, and on the 25th I withdrew to the charqueadas da Barra, where I find myself today and will proceed to Ponta Rasa, Your Excellency.\n\nI still have detachments out, and I will inform Your Excellency of any further occurrences.\n\nCharqueadas da Barra, June 27, 1842.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu"
