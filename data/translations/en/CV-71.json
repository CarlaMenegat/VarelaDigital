  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that on the 21st, at 4 in the afternoon, I had 80 men of the corps under my command on the steamer and 50 horses on \"barca n.º1,\" and around 5 in the afternoon I proceeded to the salt-curing farms of Barra, where I disembarked around 11 at night, immediately taking all necessary measures to prevent news from spreading and to procure some horses to mount the rest of the men, which I succeeded in doing; and on the 22nd, at 5 in the afternoon, I set out, and on the 23rd, at 3 in the afternoon, I surrounded the Chapel of the Sorrows under a very heavy storm, where Major Domingos Barbosa, commander of the 5th Corps of the rebels, was captured, along with a sergeant, his brother, and two soldiers; the others escaped on foot as the said chapel is in the middle of the woods, and my soldiers, being much soaked from the storm, left behind equipment and some weapons.\n\nOver 50 tame horses were recruited, and on the 25th I withdrew to the salt-curing farms of Barra, where I am today and will proceed to Ponta Rasa, Your Excellency.\n\nI still have expeditions to carry out, and I will inform Your Excellency of whatever else occurs.\n\nSalt-curing farms of Barra, June 27, 1842.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu"
