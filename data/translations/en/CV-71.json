  "translation": "I participate in Your Excellency. Your Excellency, on the 21st at 4 in the afternoon, 80 men from my command boarded the steamer and 50 horses on \"barca n.º1,\" and by 5 in the afternoon I set out for the charqueadas of Barra, where I disembarked at 11 at night, immediately taking all steps to avoid news and to find some horses to mount the rest of the people, which I achieved; and on the 22nd at 5 in the afternoon, I set out again, and on the 23rd at 3 in the afternoon, I surrounded the chapel of Dores under a very strong storm, where Major Domingos Barbosa, commander of the 5th Corps of the rebels, was captured, along with a sergeant, his brother, and two soldiers; and the others escaped on foot as the said chapel was in the middle of the thicket and my soldiers, soaked from the storm, left their gear and some weapons behind.\n\nI managed to recruit over 50 gentle horses, and on the 25th I began my retreat to the charqueadas of Barra, where I find myself today and I am heading to Ponta Rasa, Your Excellency."
