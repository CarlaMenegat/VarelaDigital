  "translation": "I inform Your Excellency, the Honorable Mr. José de Araújo Ribeiro, who entrusted me with the Command of the Police of districts 6, 7, and 8 belonging to the jurisdiction of Vila Nova do Triunfo, that I have gone to district 8 of the parish of Dores, where I remain to this date, maintaining legal order. On the 23rd of this month, I swore in Captain Manuel José de Alencastre as Justice of the Peace, who until this day had been fleeing through the desolate wilderness due to being heavily pursued by the anarchists. I also provisionally swore in the citizen José Rodrigues Tavares as the police chief, a person I trust for being very reliable and belonging to the party of legality. \n\nI have made every effort to gather the deserters from the ranks of the rebels in a cordial manner and have not made any arrests thus far, as the enemy is still very close, and I suspect that if I begin to arrest some, the others, being informed, will flee to reinforce the ranks of the rebels. I will reserve this action for when Major Paulo Alano arrives with forces to guard the coast of Camaquã. The three districts are full of anarchists and notorious thieves; the peaceful citizens and friends of legal order plead with me in tears and prevent my withdrawal, should Your Excellency Paulo Alano delay in coming. \n\nYour Excellency, all is well on this side of the creek, while a party of more than 60 men, commanded by the rebel Mariano Glória, is said to be on this side. The enemy took with them in their retreat all the horses that were in these districts, taking some peaceful residents along with their horses and even tame mares. I remain in this more dangerous place of the districts as I believe it to be where the enemies pose the greatest threat, and I will provide prompt reports of anything that occurs from now on; this is what I have the honor to bring to the esteemed knowledge of Your Excellency."
