  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency, the Most Excellent Sir José de Araújo Ribeiro, who entrusted me with the Command of the Police of the 6th, 7th, and 8th districts belonging to the jurisdiction of Vila Nova do Triunfo, that I proceeded to the 8th district of the parish of Dores, where I remain to this day, maintaining legal order. On the 23rd of the current month, I had Captain Manuel José de Alencastre sworn into the office of justice of the peace, who until that day had been fugitive through the wilderness of the deserts, having been greatly pursued by the anarchists; likewise, I provisionally installed citizen José Rodrigues Tavares in command of the police, a person whom I trust for being very reliable and belonging to the party of legality. I have made every effort to peacefully gather deserters from the ranks of the rebels and have not yet made arrests among them because the enemy is still very close, and I suspect that if some were apprehended, the others, once informed, would flee to reinforce the rebel ranks, which I reserve for when Major Paulo Alano arrives with forces to garrison the coast of Camaquã. The three districts are filled with anarchists and felonious thieves; the peaceful citizens and friends of legal order implore me tearfully and prevent my withdrawal. Your Excellency Paulo Alano may be delayed in coming, Your Most Excellent Excellency, Your Excellency, Your Excellency Camaquã, on this side of this stream remains a detachment, which I am told consists of more than 60 men, commanded by the rebel Mariano Glória, and the enemy took upon their retreat all the horses that were in these districts, forcing some peaceful residents to follow with their horses and even gentle mares. I stay in this most hazardous place of the districts as it is where I suppose I am most threatened by the enemies, and I shall promptly report on whatever may occur henceforth. This is all I have the honor to bring to the respectful knowledge of Your Excellency.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency\nMobile camp in the vicinity of Arroio do Velhaco, October 27, 1836.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Francisco das Chagas,\nCommander of the Garrison Force of the city of Porto Alegre.\n\nJoão Pedro de Abreu\nLieutenant Commander of the Police from Arroio dos Ratos to Arroio Velhaco."
