  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nI inform Your Excellency, the Most Excellent Sir José de Araújo Ribeiro, who entrusted me with the Command of the Police of the 6th, 7th, and 8th districts belonging to the jurisdiction of Vila Nova do Triunfo, that I proceeded to the 8th district of the parish of Dores, where I remain to this date, maintaining legal order. On the 23rd of this month, I caused to be sworn in the office of justice of the peace Captain Manuel José de Alencastre, who until this day had been a fugitive through the thickets of the wilderness for being heavily persecuted by the anarchists, and likewise, I swore in as interim police commander the citizen José Rodrigues Tavares, a person I trust for being very reliable and belonging to the party of legality. I have made every effort to gather through good means the deserters from the ranks of the rebels, and I have not yet made arrests among them because the enemy is still very close, and I suspect that if some begin to be arrested, the others, informed, will flee to reinforce the ranks of the rebels, which I reserve for when Major Paulo Alano arrives with forces to garrison the coast of Camaquã. The three districts are full of anarchists and heinous thieves; peaceful citizens and friends of legal order implore me tearfully and prevent my withdrawal. Your Excellency Paulo Alano may have some delay in coming, Your Excellency, Most Excellent Sir, Your Excellency, Your Excellency Camaquã, with a party on this side of this stream, said to be over 60 men, commanded by the rebel Mariano Glória, and the enemy took in their retreat all the horses that were in these districts, making some peaceful residents follow with their horses and even tame mares. I remain in this place, the most dangerous of the districts, as I suppose it to be the most threatened by the enemies, and whatever happens from now on I will promptly report; this is what I have the honor to bring to the respectable knowledge of Your Excellency.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency\n\nMobile camp near the arroio do Velhaco, October 27, 1836.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Francisco das Chagas, Commander of the Garrison Force of the city of Porto Alegre.\n\nJoão Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant Commander of the Police from the arroio dos Ratos up to the arroio Velhaco."
