  "translation": "Most Illustrious Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency, the Most Excellent Sir José de Araújo Ribeiro, who entrusted me with the Command of the Police of the 6th, 7th, and 8th districts belonging to the term of Vila Nova do Triunfo, that I proceeded to the 8th district of the parish of Dores, where I remain until this date, maintaining legal order. On the 23rd of the current month, I installed Captain Manuel José de Alencastre into the office of justice of the peace, who until that day had been fugitive through the wilderness of the deserts, having been heavily pursued by anarchists; likewise, I provisionally installed citizen José Rodrigues Tavares as police commander, a person in whom I have confidence for his great fidelity and for belonging to the party of legality. I have made every effort to gather, by good means, the deserters from the ranks of the rebels, and for now I have not made any arrests among them because the enemy is still very near, and I suspect that if some are arrested, the others, alerted, will flee to reinforce the rebel ranks. I am keeping this for when Major Paulo Alano arrives with forces to garrison the coast of Camaquã. The three districts are full of anarchists and heinous thieves; the peaceful citizens and friends of the legal order beseech me with tears and prevent my withdrawal, should Your Excellency Paulo Alano be somewhat delayed in coming. Your Excellency, Most Excellent Sir, Your Excellency, Your Excellency Camaquã, on this side of this stream remains a detachment which I am told is composed of over 60 men, commanded by the rebel Mariano Glória, and the enemy took upon their retreat all the horses that were in these districts, bringing along some peaceful residents with their horses and even docile mares. I remain in this most risky place of the districts, for I suppose it is the one most threatened by the enemies, and I will promptly report anything that happens hereafter; this is all I have the honor to bring to the respectful knowledge of Your Excellency.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.  \nMobile camp near the arroyo do Velhaco, October 27, 1836.  \nMost Illustrious Excellent Sir Francisco das Chagas,  \nCommander of the Force of the Garrison of the city of Porto Alegre.  \nJoão Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant Commander of the Police from arroyo dos Ratos up to arroyo Velhaco."
