  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir João Dias de Castro\n\nYesterday I informed Your Lordship Barra, that last Thursday Amaral Ferrador and Pedro Ribeiro had left that district of Barra with 40 men they had gathered there, to join another force at Arroio dos Ratos, commanded by Rafael Brandão.\n\nToday, a little while ago: more than an hour ago, my brother-in-law José Antônio de Araújo Ribeiro came to find me to inform me that Bento Manuel Ribeiro was with a force of four hundred cavalrymen, in red jackets, at the charqueadas of Freguesia Nova, conscripting as many blacks as they could find with arms; and that he knew this because Antônio José Pires, son-in-law of João da Costa, had sent word last night to his overseer on Fanfa Island to withdraw the blacks, but this overseer, instead of embarking with the blacks, had embarked alone to report to him, and he sent him back today at once to fetch the blacks.\n\nBecause of the said red jackets, there is suspicion they did not come from Rio Grande; in short, I report to Your Lordship what I have been told and remain,\n\nAnd send orders as you can to whom they concern, with respect, your venerating subject and servant. S.C., January 22, 1839. Pedro José Gomes de Abreu."
