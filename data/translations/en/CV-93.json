  "translation": "Yesterday, I saw Your Lordship Barra, who on Thursday past had left that district of Barra, Amaral Ferrador, and Pedro Ribeiro, with 40 men they had gathered there, to join another force at Arroio dos Ratos, commanded by Rafael Brandão.\n\nToday, not long ago: over an hour ago, my brother-in-law José Antônio de Araújo Ribeiro found me, as he was looking for me to inform me that Bento Manuel Ribeiro was with a force of four hundred cavalrymen, in red shirts, in the salt flats of Freguesia Nova, capturing as many blacks as they could get their hands on; and he knew this because Antônio José Pires, son-in-law of João da Costa, had sent word last night to his foreman on the island of Fanfa to evacuate the blacks, but this foreman, instead of boarding with the blacks, had only boarded himself to come and inform him, and that he made him return today to march back to fetch the blacks.\n\nDue to such a uniform of red shirts, there is suspicion they may not have come from Rio Grande; anyway, I share what they told me and Your Lordship."
