  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir João Dias de Castro\n\nYesterday I made Your Lordship aware that at the charqueadas of Barra, on the past Thursday, Amaral Ferrador and Pedro Ribeiro had left that district of Barra with 40 men they had gathered there, to join another force at Arroio dos Ratos, commanded by Rafael Brandão.\n\nToday, just over an hour ago, my brother-in-law José Antônio de Araújo Ribeiro came to see me to inform me that Bento Manuel Ribeiro was with a force of four hundred cavalrymen, wearing red jackets, at the charqueadas of Freguesia Nova, seizing as many black men as they could find who were armed; and that he knew this because Antônio José Pires, son-in-law of João da Costa, had sent word last night to his foreman on Ilha do Fanfa to withdraw the blacks, but that this foreman, instead of boarding with the blacks, had boarded alone to report to him, and that he had sent him back today immediately to fetch the blacks.\n\nBecause of those red jackets, it is suspected they do not come from Rio Grande; in any case, I report to Your Lordship what was told to me.\n\nAnd command as you can to whom it concerns, with respect, your venerating and devoted servant. S.C., 22 January 1839. Pedro José Gomes de Abreu."
