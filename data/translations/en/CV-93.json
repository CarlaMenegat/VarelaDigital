  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir João Dias de Castro\n\nYesterday I informed Your Excellency at Barra that last Thursday Amaral Ferrador and Pedro Ribeiro had left that district of Barra with 40 men they had gathered there, to join another force at the arroio dos Ratos, commanded by Rafael Brandão.\n\nToday, a little while ago: for more than an hour, my brother-in-law José Antônio de Araújo Ribeiro met with me, seeking to inform me that Bento Manuel Ribeiro was with a force of four hundred cavalrymen, wearing red tunics, at the charqueadas of Freguesia Nova, taking up arms any black men they could enlist; and that he knew this because Antônio José Pires, son-in-law of João da Costa, had ordered his overseer on the island of Fanfa yesterday night to withdraw the black men, but that this overseer, instead of embarking with the black men, had embarked alone to report this to him, and that he had him return today immediately on the march to fetch the black men.\n\nBecause of such red liveries, it is suspected they may not be from Rio Grande; in any case I report what has been told me and Your Excellency\n\nMay give orders as you see fit to whom it may concern, with respect, your venerating and devoted subject. S.C., January 22, 1839. Pedro José Gomes de Abreu."
