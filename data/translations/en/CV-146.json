  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nDeliberating that the government should retreat to the capital, I was ordered to take charge of it in advance and there reestablish order, and with it prevent disturbances and maintain public tranquility, but having few men at his disposal, men necessary for patrols, delivery of correspondence, pumping, and butchering, it is therefore not possible that all these be done with the few elements he has.\n\nConsequently, Captain Laurindo and Lieutenant Manuel Antônio, who are now following me to Caçapava, have been left behind, with Lieutenant Januário remaining with the Vice-president in Vacacaí. Besides these reasons, another circumstance counts, that, as they say, Juca Cipriano, Dedeco, and Fialho have remained around São Gabriel, so that only about twenty or thirty more men will not be missed by Your Excellency.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency. João Machado, 25, at dawn, March of 1840. Most Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira. Serafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nPresidency of the Republic Secretariat Colonel João Antônio da Silveira, Commander of the Right Wing Division. Wherever he may be found. From the Ministry of War."
