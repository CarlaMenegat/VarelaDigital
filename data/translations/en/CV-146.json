  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nDeliberating that the government should retreat to the capital, I was ordered to go ahead and take charge of it and there reestablish order, and with it prevent disturbances and maintain public tranquility; but having few men at my disposal, men necessary for patrols, delivery of official documents, pumping operations, and slaughtering, it is therefore not possible that all this can be done with the few elements available.\n\nConsequently, Captain Laurindo and Lieutenant Manuel Antônio, who are now going with me to Caçapava, will not march; Lieutenant Januário has remained with the Vice-President in Vacacaí. Besides these reasons, there is another circumstance, that Juca Cipriano, Dedeco, Fialho have remained, so they say, near São Gabriel; likewise, only about twenty or thirty more men will not be missed by Your Lordship.\n\nGod preserve Your Lordship. João Machado, 25, at dawn, March 1840. Most Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira. Serafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nSecretariat of the Presidency of the Republic Colonel João Antônio da Silveira, Commander of the Right Division. Wherever you may be. From the Ministry of War."
