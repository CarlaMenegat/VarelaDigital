  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nThe government, deliberating to retreat to the capital, ordered me to take charge of it in advance and restore order there, and with it to prevent disturbances and maintain public tranquility; but having few men at his disposal—men necessary for patrols, delivery of official documents, firefighting, and meat processing—it is not, therefore, possible that all this be done with the few elements he has.\n\nConsequently, Captain Laurindo and Lieutenant Manuel Antônio, who are now following me to Caçapava, will not march; Lieutenant Januário has remained with the Vice-president at Vacacaí. Besides these reasons, another circumstance militates, as they say Juca Cipriano, Dedeco, and Fialho have remained in the vicinity of São Gabriel, so that only twenty or thirty men more will not be missed by Your Excellency.\n\nMay God guard Your Excellency. João Machado, 25, at dawn, March of 1840. Most Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira. Serafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nPresidency Secretariat of the Republic Colonel João Antônio da Silveira, Commander of the Right Division. Wherever found. From the Ministry of War."
