  "translation": "Debating the government’s decision to move back to the capital, it ordered me to take care of it in advance and to restore order there, in order to prevent disturbances and maintain public tranquility. However, having very few people at my disposal—necessary for patrols, the handling of duties, firefighting, and butchering—it is not possible to accomplish all this with the few resources I have.\n\nAs a consequence, Captain Laurindo and Lieutenant Manuel Antônio are not marching, as they are now following me to Caçapava, while Lieutenant Januário remained with the Vice-president in Vacacaí. In addition to these reasons, there is another circumstance: Juca Cipriano, Dedeco, and Fialho have reportedly stayed around São Gabriel, which means that only twenty or thirty more men will not make a difference to Your Excellency."
