  "translation": "Insuperable inconveniences have delayed our operations in Rio Grande, and the occupation of the capital by the insurgents, depriving us of the resources that came to us from there by mouth and war, has greatly saddened the patriots, seeing armed citizens suffering beyond expectation, and that this suffering could be limited if circumstances do not improve promptly.\n\nThe apologists of the opposing party have opened their treasures for their followers, who lack nothing, and this disproportion will be sufficient to change the face of our affairs in an instant. Such considerations have compelled His Excellency Sir Your Honor to the sum of one thousand five hundred patacões, which I do by this present, as I cannot neglect another business of equal importance; assuring Your Honor\n\nBy the bearer, Mr. , Your Honor will send."
