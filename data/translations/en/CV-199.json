Such considerations have compelled Your Excellency Sir Your Lordship to one thousand five hundred patacões, which I do hereby, for I cannot abandon another matter of equal importance; assuring Your Lordship\n\nBy the bearer, Sir, Your Lordship will send\n\nGod keep Your Lordship Pelotas, July 22, 1836. Most Illustrious Sir Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães. Domingos José de Almeida Colonel Chief of Legion.\n\nPublic Service. Most Illustrious Sir Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães. From the Colonel Chief of the Legion of the District of Rio Grande."
