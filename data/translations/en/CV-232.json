  "translation": "Acknowledging receipt of your letters dated the 13th, 18th, and 19th of the current month, I must inform you that to Dom Lourenço: I will satisfy the cost of the barrel of flour, I mean, sugar, from your order, which I estimated because 2 that Varejão sent me via Maia either got left behind by oversight or evaporated on the way. Through Pedro Lopes, I sent 3 sacks of flour; 2 stayed here, and according to a notice from the same Varejão, 3 are missing, one being wheat flour. Regarding myself, do not have the slightest care, for while I could confuse the slander and malice of my enemies, I will continue in service to the homeland, but in such a way that the lightning of envy does not strike me a second time. While waiting for Bento Gonçalves, and even to finalize my accounts, I have not been able to get there, which I will do immediately as soon as I can.\n\nI am sending you the list of items sent by João da Cunha in two carts, which were deposited at Granja's house, including 200 small nails, which are the smallest found; perhaps these will suffice to arrange the work for the little cart.\n\nToday I set aside at Damasceno's house one piece of devil's skin and 4 pieces of cotton fabric for the slaves' clothing, which I will send at the first opportunity, along with the 2 sacks of flour that are here, and another barrel of sugar, which Damasceno will charge me for, as he should.\n\nToday we are moving, as the owner of the house is arriving with his family. Send me a wide strap from the canteen that was left there, without which perhaps the rest that came cannot be arranged.\n\nPost scriptum"
