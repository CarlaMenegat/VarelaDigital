  "translation": "Piratini, November 24, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nAcknowledging the receipt of your letters of the 13th, 18th, and 19th of this month, I must tell you that for Dom Lourenço: I will pay the amount for the barrel of flour, I mean, of sugar, from your order, which I estimated because two that Varejão sent me via Maia either were left there by forgetfulness or evaporated along the way. Through Pedro Lopes, I sent three sacks of flour, two remained here, and according to the same Varejão’s notice, three are missing, one being wheat flour. As for me, have no concern at all, since I can distinguish the slander and spite of my enemies; I will continue in the service of the homeland, but in such a way that the lightning of envy will not strike me a second time. Waiting for Bento Gonçalves, and even to settle my accounts, I have not been able to arrive there, which I will do immediately as soon as I can.\n\nI send you the list of goods sent by João da Cunha in two carts, which were deposited in the Granja house, such as 200 rip nails, which are the smallest that could be found; perhaps with these the work on the little cart can be fixed.\n\nToday I set aside at Damasceno’s house a piece of devil leather and four pieces of cotton cloth for the clothing of the slaves, which I will send at the first opportunity, as well as the two sacks of flour that are here, and another barrel of sugar, Damasceno will give it to me at cost, as he should.\n\nToday we are moving because the owner of the house is arriving with his family. Send me a broad leather strap from the canana that was left there, without which perhaps it will not be possible to make use of the rest that came.\n\nGive my regards to our parents, siblings, and acquaintances; hug our children for me, and receive the heart of Your Almeida.\n\nPost scriptum\n\nLady. Pedras Altas."
