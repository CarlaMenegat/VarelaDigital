  "translation": "Piratini, November 24, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your letters from the 13th, 18th, and 19th of this month, I must tell you that to Dom Lourenço: I will pay the amount for the barrel of flour, I mean, sugar, from your order, which I valued because the two that Varejão sent me through Maia either remained there by oversight or evaporated along the way. Through Pedro Lopes, I sent 3 sacks of flour, 2 remained here, and according to the same Varejão's notice, 3 are missing, one of which is wheat flour. Do not have the slightest care regarding me, for being able to confuse the slander and spite of my enemies, I will continue in the service of the fatherland, but in such a way that the lightning of envy does not strike me a second time. Awaiting Bento Gonçalves, and even to finalize my accounts, I have not been able to arrive there, which I will do immediately when I can.\n\nI send you the list of the goods sent by João da Cunha in two carts, which were deposited at the Granja house, such as 200 small nails for boarding; with these same nails, perhaps the work on the small cart can be managed.\n\nToday I separated at Damasceno's house a piece of devil leather and 4 of cotton fabric for the slaves' clothing, which I will send at the first opportunity, as well as the 2 sacks of flour that are here, and another barrel of sugar, Damasceno will give it to me at cost, as he should.\n\nToday we are moving because the house owner is arriving with his family. Send me a wide strap for the canana (a type of harness) that remained there, without which perhaps it will not be possible to use the rest that came.\n\nGive my regards to our parents, siblings, and acquaintances; embrace our children for me and receive the heart of Your Almeida\n\nPost scriptum\n\nSenhora. Pedras Altas."
