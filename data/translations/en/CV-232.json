  "translation": "Piratini, November 24, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nAcknowledging the receipt of your letters of the 13th, 18th, and 19th of this month, I must tell you that to Dom Lourenço: I will pay the amount for the barrel of flour, I mean, sugar, from your order, which I appreciated because two that Varejão sent me by Maia either remained there by mistake or evaporated on the way. Through Pedro Lopes, I sent three sacks of flour, two stayed here, and according to notice from the same Varejão, three are missing, one of them wheat flour. Do not worry about me in the slightest, because although I can confuse the slander and malice of my enemies, I will continue serving the homeland, but in such a way that the lightning of envy shall not strike me a second time. Waiting for Bento Gonçalves, and even to settle my accounts, I have not been able to arrive there, which I will do as soon as possible.\n\nI am sending you the list of items sent by João da Cunha in two carts, which were deposited at the house at Granja, such as 200 small fencing nails, which are the smallest that could be found; perhaps with them one can fix the little cart’s work.\n\nToday I set apart at Damasceno’s house a piece of devil’s leather and four pieces of cotton cloth for the slaves’ clothing, which I will send at the first opportunity, along with the two sacks of flour that are here, and another barrel of sugar, which Damasceno will give me at cost, as he ought.\n\nToday we are moving because the owner of the house is arriving with his family. Send me a wide strap from the canana that remained there, without which it might not be possible to manage the rest of what came.\n\nGive my regards to our parents, siblings, and acquaintances; embrace our children for me and receive the heart of Your Almeida\n\nPost scriptum\n\nMadam. Pedras Altas."
