  "translation": "Dear Bernardina of the heart  \nPiratini, December 14, 1837.\n\nDue to the haste with which the bearer is about to leave, this letter serves only to make you aware that I am greatly improved in my foot; besides this, I inform you that tomorrow my friend Bento Gonçalves will arrive here, after which it may be that I pay a visit there.\n\nHave someone tell me how our children are doing, to whom you will give many embraces, and you will recommend me to the godfather and godmother, and also to the family of José Rodrigues; and you can always count on your very loving Husband Almeida.\n\nGreetings from me to Your Mercy Carlota. Peçanha\n\nMadam.  \nPedras Altas."
