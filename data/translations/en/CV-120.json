  "translation": "Having the Most Excellent Señor Antônio Pedro João Pedro, if he does not withdraw from this same district, because it is evident that around Arroio Velhaco there are anarchists hiding in shacks, where it is to be supposed that the famous Manuel Antônio, an anarchist, former justice of the peace, and the one from the neighboring district of São João named João Evangelista, are found; therefore, it is of great importance to maintain a force here to repel any assault from these wretches whose intentions are to assassinate the peaceful, and even their own companions who have shown up here.\n\nI hope that Your Excellency of these esteemed men in legal authority and among anarchists, it is not possible for me without risking lives."
