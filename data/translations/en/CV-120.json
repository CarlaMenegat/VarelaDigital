  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nThe Most Excellent Sir Antônio Pedro João Pedro having not left this same district, because it is certain that in the vicinity of Arroio Velhaco there are anarchists who have taken refuge in huts, where it is supposed that the famous Manuel Antônio, anarchist, former justice of the peace, and one from the neighboring district of São João by the name of João Evangelista, are found; therefore, it is of great necessity to maintain here a force sufficient to repel any assault by these wicked men whose intentions are to murder the peaceful, and even their own comrades who have appeared here.\n\nI hope that Your Excellency understands that from these honorable men, legal authorities, and among anarchists it is not possible for me to act without risking lives.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nDistrito das Dores, October 27, 1836.  \nManuel José de Alencastre, Justice of the Peace of the chapel of Dores."
