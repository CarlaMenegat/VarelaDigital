  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nHaving learned from the Excellent Sir Antônio Pedro João Pedro that he has not left this same district, because it is certain that in the vicinity of Arroio Velhaco there are anarchists sheltered in huts, where it is supposed to be found the celebrated Manuel Antônio, anarchist, former justice of the peace, and the one from the neighboring district of São João by the name João Evangelista; therefore, it is of great necessity that a force of equivalent strength be maintained here to repel any assault by these evildoers, whose intentions are to murder the peaceful, and even their own comrades who have appeared here.\n\nI hope that Your Excellency, these honorable men, legal authorities and among anarchists, it is not possible without risk to lives.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency.  \nDistrito das Dores, October 27, 1836.  \nManuel José de Alencastre, Justice of the Peace of the chapel of Dores."
