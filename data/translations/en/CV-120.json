  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nHis Excellency Senhor Antônio Pedro João Pedro having instructed me not to leave this same district, because it is certain that in the vicinity of Arroio Velhaco there are anarchists sheltered in malocas, where it is supposed the famous Manuel Antônio, anarchist, former justice of the peace, and the one from the neighboring district of São João named João Evangelista are found; therefore, it is of great necessity to maintain here an equivalent force to repel any assault from these wicked men whose intentions are to assassinate the peaceful, and even their own companions who have appeared here.\n\nI hope that Your Excellency will understand that from these honorable men, legal authorities and among anarchists, it is not possible for me without risking lives.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nDistrito das Dores, October 27, 1836  \nManuel José de Alencastre, Justice of the Peace of the chapel of Dores."
