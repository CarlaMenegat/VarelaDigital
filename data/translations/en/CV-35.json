  "translation": "My most esteemed godfather and friend  \nPiratini, September 5, 1842.\n\nBefore receiving your most esteemed letter of the 18th of last month, I had written to you sending the bill that was in the possession of ... however, it follows for that to Captain Miguel to whom I am about to give news of myself and my family; I am going through, as always already known, with my ailments, your godmother also does not enjoy much health, which is not the case with your goddaughter who is very fat and lively and without having bladders despite no caution.\n\nI would greatly appreciate having the pleasure of seeing you here for the festival and my esteemed godmother; I do not offer you my house because I was warned by the owner to vacate it and Mr. Joaquim Pedro Soares is coming to it, because he is the commander of the Left Division and for all that he can do, and moreover I have to go to the middle of the street because there are no rental houses; finally this time I will have to go live in Pelotas; there are many there and even for free; the delay is while waiting for the bearer from Alegrete that Joaquim Pedro sent to the government, seeing that they said that as it had been rented by the State with him, that Dutra should deal with it.\n\nI, the only hope I have is having offered my arrears for one year of rent; if that has already been settled, as I hope, it will be good, otherwise I will resort to everything.\n\nI inform you that you had one hundred and ninety and some votes at the popular table of this city for Deputy and I am convinced that, despite your enemies working for you not to be, they will not succeed; I say this because of the ticket from Alegrete where neither you nor godfather José Mariano appear.\n\nRegarding news from Rio, certainly nothing is known because some paper that appears besides those of the government which give São Paulo all finished, Feijó imprisoned and sent to Rio, Tobias escaped, etc.\n\nYour godmother highly recommends herself to Your Excellency.  \nYour godfather and sincere friend  \nAntônio José de Abreu  \n\nNota Bene Santa Isabel to Alegrete; he complains to me about not receiving letters from you because he says he is your friend, even if without profit, and that he does not know if he received the papers he sent you.\n\nTo the citizen Domingos José de Almeida. Bagé.\n\nEnclosed is a letter for Santa Isabel."
