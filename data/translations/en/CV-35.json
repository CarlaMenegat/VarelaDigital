  "translation": "Piratini, September 5, 1842.\n\nBefore receiving your esteemed letter of the 18th of last month, I had written to you enclosing the letter that was in the possession of ... however, Captain Miguel is going to bring news of me and my family; I continue to go on as always, as you already know with my ailments. Your comadre also does not enjoy good health, which is not the case with your goddaughter, who is very plump and lively and has no issues despite any precautions.\n\nI would greatly appreciate the pleasure of seeing you here for the festival along with my esteemed comadre; I do not offer you my house because I was warned by the owner to vacate it so that Mr. Joaquim Pedro Soares can move in, as he is the commander of the Left Division and therefore has that authority. Additionally, I have to go out into the street because there are no rental houses available; in short, this time I will have to move to Pelotas; there are many there, and even free of charge; the delay is as I await a messenger from Alegrete whom Joaquim Pedro sent to the government since it was said that having been rented by the State, it is with him that Dutra should deal.\n\nThe only hope I have is having offered my back rent for a year of housing; if that is already arranged, as I hope, then it will be good; otherwise, I will resort to everything.\n\nI inform you that he received one hundred and ninety-some votes at the popular table in this city for Deputy, and I am convinced that, despite his enemies working against him, they will not succeed; I say this regarding the slate from Alegrete where neither you nor comrade José Mariano appears.\n\nAs for news from Rio, nothing is certain because some papers that appear besides those of the government say everything is finished, Feijó is imprisoned and sent to Rio, Tobias has fled, etc.\n\nNota Bene Santa Isabel for Alegrete; he complains to me about not receiving your letters because he says he is your friend, albeit without benefit, and does not know if he received the papers you sent him.\n\nTo citizen Domingos José de Almeida. Bagé.\n\nEnclosed is a letter for Santa Isabel."
