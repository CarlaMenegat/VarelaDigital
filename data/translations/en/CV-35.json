  "translation": "My most esteemed godfather and friend  \nPiratini, September 5, 1842.\n\nBefore receiving your most esteemed letter of the 18th of last month, I had written to you sending the draft that was in the possession of ... however, it now goes to Piratini with Captain Miguel, to whom I will give news of myself and my family; I am going on, as always, as you already know, with my ailments, your godmother also does not enjoy good health, which is somewhat different from your goddaughter who is very fat and lively and, despite all caution, has no blisters.\n\nI would be very glad to have the pleasure of seeing you here for the festival and also my esteemed godmother; I do not offer you my house because I was notified by the owner to vacate it so that Senhor Joaquim Pedro Soares could come, as he is the commander of the Left Division and therefore can do everything; furthermore, I have to go out into the street because there are no houses for rent; in short, this time I will have to live in Pelotas; there are many houses there, even for free; the delay is because we wait for the bearer from Alegrete whom Joaquim Pedro sent to the government, since it was said that as it was rented by the State it should be managed with him and not with Dutra.\n\nI, the only hope I have is that I have offered my arrears for one year’s rent; if this is already settled, as I hope, it will be good, otherwise I will resort to everything.\n\nI inform you that you had one hundred and ninety votes at the popular table of this city for Deputy and I am convinced that despite your enemies working against you, they will not succeed; I say this because of the Alegrete ticket where neither you nor godfather José Mariano appear.\n\nAs for news from Rio, certainly nothing is known because some paper appears beyond those of the government that are printed in São Paulo, saying all is finished, Feijó arrested and sent to Rio, Tobias fled, etc.\n\nYour godmother sends her kind regards to Your Excellency.  \nYour godfather and sincere friend  \nAntônio José de Abreu  \nNota Bene Santa Isabel to Alegrete; he complains to me of not receiving drafts from you because he says he is your friend, albeit useless, and that he does not know if he received the papers he sent you.\n\nTo citizen Domingos José de Almeida.  \nBagé.\n\nEnclosed a letter to Santa Isabel."
