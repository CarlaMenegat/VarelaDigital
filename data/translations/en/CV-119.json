  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir Cerro Largo, October 3, 1842\n\nDear friend. Moved by the friendship you have been kind enough to show me and which I appreciate to the degree it merits, and desirous on the other hand to serve a friend, I address you, troubling your attention, so that you may kindly inform me about the points to which the enclosed refers, with the brevity possible for you.\n\nOn this occasion, I remain as always your true friend, wishing to have the satisfaction that you occupy the uselessness of your faithful servant who kisses your hands. Manuel de Aleman\n\nPostscript\n\nMost illustrious citizen Don Domingo José de Almeida — Bagé.\n\nAnswered on October 22, 1842.\n\nIt was annexed to the letter from Manuel de la Hoz dated October 2, 1842."
