  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that Ibicuí, with 80 cavalrymen, according to Your Excellency’s orders, proceeded to Santa Maria, where a captain, 8 rebel soldiers, 16 horses and colts were captured, and I had sent to this place 5 carts of goods containing salt, wheat flour, sugars, and fabrics; I bought for the nation 180 arrobas of yerba mate and 100 alqueires of manioc flour, and all remained today on this side.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Melo, whom I request your assistance for, promptly marched with his battalion making forced marches, up to half the way, to protect my retreat and the passage of the pass with all the supplies. David Canabarro, Guedes, and Demétrio marched towards Alegrete, to from there pursue Colonel Loureiro; Bento Gonçalves is in Batovi with the Infantry; it is said he is going to Bagé; Portinho is said to have stopped at Cruz Alta; I believe he intends to retire to Botucaraí, and Joaquim Pedro, going to Encruzilhada with 100 men, proceeded to the Cachoeira.\n\nMay God preserve Your Excellency.\n\nRincão do Inhamandá, July 14, 1841.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto, Brigadier and Commander-in-Chief of the Army.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel."
