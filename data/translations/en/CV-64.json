  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nI inform Your Excellency that I went to Ibicuí, with 80 cavalrymen, according to Your Excellency's orders to Santa Maria, where a captain, 8 rebel soldiers, 16 horses and colts were surprised, and I sent 5 wagons with salt, wheat flour, sugar and cloth to this place; I bought for the nation 180 arrobas of mate herb and 100 alqueires of manioc flour, and all remained today on this side.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Melo, asking for your assistance, promptly marched with his battalion making forced marches halfway, to protect my retreat and the passage of the ford with all the goods. David Canabarro and Guedes and Demétrio marched to Alegrete to pursue Colonel Loureiro from there; Bento Gonçalves is at Batovi, with the Infantry; they say he is going to Bagé; Portinho is said to have stopped at Cruz Alta; I believe he intends to withdraw to Botucaraí, and Joaquim Pedro going to Encruzilhada with 100 men, proceeded to Cachoeira.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nRincão do Inhamandá, July 14, 1841  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto  \nBrigadier and Commander-in-Chief of the Army  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant Colonel"
