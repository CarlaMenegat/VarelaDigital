  "translation": "I inform Your Excellency Ibicuí, with 80 cavalrymen, according to the orders of Your Excellency Santa Maria, where a captain, 8 rebel soldiers, 16 horses, and colts were surprised, and I sent 5 wagons with goods containing salt, wheat flour, sugars, and merchandise; I purchased for the nation 180 arrobas of mate herb and 100 alqueires of manioc flour, and everything remained today on this side.\n\nColonel Melo, requesting your assistance, promptly marched with his battalion making forced marches, to protect my retreat and the passage of all the supplies. David Canabarro and Guedes and Demétrio marched to Alegrete, to pursue Colonel Loureiro from there; Bento Gonçalves is in Batovi, with the Infantry; they say he is going to Bagé; it is said that Portinho has stopped at Cruz Alta; I believe he intends to retreat to Botucaraí, and Joaquim Pedro, going to the Encruzilhada with 100 men, made his way to Cachoeira."
