  "translation": "My most esteemed godfather and lord Piratini, October 24, 1841.\n\nYesterday I took possession of your esteemed letter of the 16th of this month accompanying the power of attorney for the friend Mateus and his lady, as well as the official letter for Freitas to deliver to me one hundred thousand réis from the proceeds of the auction of the late Ledek's goods, for which I thank you very much, however, unfortunately it has no effect as I was informed that the net amount was delivered here to Shemit and that he gave orders to Fayete to have it collected in the Treasury, the bearer being the son of Major Pires who left here for there on the 21st; anyway, patience. All the resources by Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency Guilherme Schnepf; I think I have all the justice; Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency\n\nThe health of Your Excellency From Your Excellency Godfather friend, thank you very much Antônio José de Abreu\n\nReturns the official letter from Freitas.
