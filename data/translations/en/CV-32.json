  "translation": "My most esteemed godfather and lord  \nPiratini, October 24, 1841.\n\nYesterday I took possession of your esteemed letter of the 16th of this month, accompanying the power of attorney for our friend Mateus and his lady, as well as the official letter for Freitas to give me one hundred thousand réis from the proceeds of the auction of the goods of the late Ledek, for which I thank you greatly; however, unfortunately it has no effect for I was informed that the net amount was delivered here to Shemit and that he gave orders to Fayete to have it collected in the Treasury, the bearer being the son of Major Pires who left here for there on the 21st; in short, patience. All resources by Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency Guilherme Schnepf; I believe it is fully just; Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency.\n\nThe health of Your Excellency  \nFrom Your Excellency  \nGodfather and friend, many thanks  \nAntônio José de Abreu\n\nThe official letter from Freitas is returned. Replied to on November 5, 1841."
