  "translation": "Piratini, October 24, 1841.\n\nYesterday, I received your esteemed letter of the 16th of the current month, accompanying the power of attorney for my friend Mateus and his wife, as well as the document for Freitas to hand me one hundred thousand réis from the proceeds of the auction of the late Ledek’s assets, for which I am very grateful. However, unfortunately, it had no effect as I was informed that the net amount had been delivered here to Shemit, and that he had ordered Fayete to collect it in the Treasury, with the bearer being the son of Major Pires who left here for that place on the 21st; well, patience. All resources from Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency Guilherme Schnepf; I think I have every right; Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency.\n\nReturns Freitas' document. Responded on November 5, 1841."
