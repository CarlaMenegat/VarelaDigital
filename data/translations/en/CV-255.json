  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, September 17, 1838.\n\nThis afternoon José arrived with yours from yesterday, and since some dancers are scheduled here for the 20th, I am sending the Catraio to see if you can come in time, so you can enjoy yourself a little, considering that the stage is right in front of our house, which, although small, will accommodate us.\n\nBring Custódia to see if a French doctor who is here can cure her ailment. Let the friend Bruto not be left out. I am getting better from my scabies with the baths prescribed by the same Frenchman. I hope Carlota is as desired, although she may regret it afterward, and both she and you are what we came here looking for.\n\nOur 21st is also at hand, and see to it that it passes without incident. The letters from compadre João are on their way, and farewell.\n\nLonging to all in general, hugs to our children, and receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nMadam Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida  \nBom Retiro."
