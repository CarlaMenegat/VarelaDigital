  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, September 17, 1838.\n\nThis afternoon José arrived with yours from yesterday, and as some dancers are planned here for the 20th, I am sending the Catraio to see if you can come in time, so that you may enjoy yourself a little, considering the platform is right in front of our house, which, although small, will accommodate us.\n\nBring Custódia to see if a French doctor who is here can cure her discomfort. The friend Bruto must not stay. I am getting better from my scabies with the baths prescribed by the same Frenchman. I hope Carlota is as you wished, although she will regret it later, and both she and you are what came here to seek.\n\nOur 21st is also approaching, and see that he does not remain idle. The letters from compadre João are going, and farewell.\n\nLonging to all in general, hugs to our children, and receive Almeida’s heart.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida  \nBom Retiro."
