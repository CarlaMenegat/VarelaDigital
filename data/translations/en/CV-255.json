  "translation": "This afternoon, José arrived with your letter from yesterday, and since some dancers are being scheduled here for the 20th, I am sending the Catraio to see if you can come in time, so you can have some fun, considering that the stage is right in front of our house, which I suppose is small, we will fit.\n\nBring Custódia to see if a French doctor who is here can cure her of her discomfort. The friend Bruto should not stay. I am improving my skin issues with the baths prescribed by the same Frenchman. I hope that Carlota is as I wished, although later she will regret it, and both she and you came here looking for that.\n\nOur 21 is also at the door, and see if you leave him without exercise. The letters from compadre João are going, and goodbye."
