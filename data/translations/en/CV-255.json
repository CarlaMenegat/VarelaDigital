  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, September 17, 1838.\n\nThis afternoon José arrived with your letter from yesterday, and as some dancers are being planned here for the 20th, I am sending Catraio to see if you can come in time, so you can have some fun, since the stage is right in front of our house, which, although small, will hold us.\n\nBring Custódia to see if a French doctor who is here can cure her discomfort. Let the friend Bruto not stay. I am improving from my scabies with the baths prescribed by the same Frenchman. I hope Carlota is as you wished, although she will later regret it, and both she and you are what was sought here.\n\nOur 21 is also at the door, and see that it does not remain unused. The letters from godfather João go along, and farewell.\n\nLonging for all in general, hugs to our children, and receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida  \nBom Retiro."
