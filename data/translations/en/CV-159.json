  "translation": "Friend and Lord, Rosário, July 23.\n\nHere I send you the tariff I had mentioned to you. I will pretend it is a copy of a letter I addressed to another friend. You well saw the small space a hut offers for writing, and therefore, out of laziness, I did not transfer it to another sheet. Prepare yourself patiently to read such a lengthy lament.\n\nKnow that I have rejoiced greatly at the new appointments. That of Olivério seems very good to me; that of Hildebrando very fitting; and that of Chagas; in short, if the government continues to progress in this manner, it should always count me among its apologists and defenders.\n\nYou will excuse that I still touch on some public matters. One of them is the increase that should be given to our infantry and artillery corps, and to bring the line cavalry corps to the utmost height of numerical strength.\n\nBelieve me, friend, that if we do not have at least 2,500 to 3,000 infantrymen and as many line cavalry, we have nothing.\n\nThe government must order the generals to wear the uniforms that are proper to them: this greatly contributes to awakening a certain influence among the young officers. The military must have enthusiasm and even a certain imposing air. A general who always appears in a poncho, sometimes even in a denim jacket and a wide-brimmed hat, what influence can he arouse?\n\nIt reminds me of a saying of Colonel Damasceno; he used to say: \"listen to that republic where the generals go about in burlap ponchos,\" referring to General Neto, who wore some white ponchos. Could anyone think this is a trifle? On the contrary, it greatly influences the discipline of an army.\n\nI send you the list of items I need for my corps, advising that the swords be straight, for our officers are so accustomed to them that, if others come, they will promptly discard them. Likewise the pistols: since these appeared, one no longer sees a pistol. Giving a pistol to any soldier is the same as throwing it away; and this because they prefer pistols with a longer barrel. If you order the bands, let them also have wide fringe and all be uniform, otherwise it is money wasted; the pants should also be identical and of good quality. If the cloth and lace for the trumpeters could come, it would be a fortune. I will have from fifteen to twenty cornets for the music band, and there are only three instruments; the general tells me he sent for more, yet I hope you send those I ask for. The letter goes to ex-Lieutenant Ferreira.\n\nSend frankly to those who take pride in being faithful Your obliged friend and compatriot Serafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nNota bene"
