  "translation": "Friend and Lord Rosário, July 23.\n\nHere I send you the tariff I mentioned to you. I will pretend it is a copy of a letter I addressed to another friend. You have rightly seen the smallness of a hut for writing, and for that and laziness, I have not passed it to another paper. Prepare yourself with patience to read such a prolix jeremiad.\n\nKnow that I have greatly exulted over the new appointments. The one of Olivério seems very good to me; that of Hildebrando very fitting; and that of Chagas; in short, if the government continues to march this way, it should always count me among its apologists and defenders.\n\nYou will forgive that I still touch on some public matters. One of these is the increase that must be given to our infantry and artillery corps, and to raise to the utmost numerical strength the line cavalry corps.\n\nBelieve me, friend, that if we do not have at least 2,500 to 3,000 infantrymen and as many line cavalrymen, we have nothing.\n\nThe government must order the generals to use the uniforms proper to them: this greatly helps to awaken a certain influence in the young officers. The military must have enthusiasm and even a certain air of imposingness. A general who always appears in a poncho, sometimes even in a denim jacket and a wide-brimmed hat, what influence can he excite?\n\nIt reminds me of a saying of Colonel Damasceno; he said: \"oh what a republic where the generals go about in sackcloth ponchos,\" referring to General Neto, who used some white ponchos. Could anyone think this is a trifle? On the contrary, it greatly affects the discipline of an army.\n\nI send you the list of items I need for my corps, advising that the swords be straight, for our officers are so accustomed that if others come, they immediately discard them. Likewise the large pistols: after these appeared, no pistol is seen anymore. Giving a pistol to any private is the same as throwing it away; and this is because they prefer the large pistols. If you order the bands, they should also be wide-fringed and all even, otherwise it is wasted money; the tadpoles should also be brothers and guarantors. If the cloth and cord for the trumpeters could come, it would be a fortune. I will have from fifteen to twenty cornets for the music band, and there are only three instruments; the general tells me he ordered more, however I wish you to send the ones I ask you for. The letter goes to ex-Lieutenant Ferreira.\n\nSend frankly to those who esteem themselves faithful Your obliged friend and compatriot Serafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nNota bene"
