  "translation": "Friend and Lord Rosario, July 23.\n\nHere I send you the tariff I mentioned to you. I will pretend it is a copy of a letter I addressed to another friend. You well saw the limited space a hut offers for writing, and because of that and laziness, I did not transfer it to another sheet. Prepare yourself with patience to read such a lengthy complaint.\n\nKnow that I have greatly rejoiced at the new appointments. Olivério's seems very good to me; Hildebrando's very fitting; and Chagas's; in short, if the government continues to proceed this way, it should always count me among its apologists and defenders.\n\nYou will excuse me if I still touch upon some public matters. One of them is the increase that must be given to our infantry and artillery corps, and to bring the line cavalry corps to the utmost peak of numerical strength.\n\nBelieve me, friend, that if we do not have at least 2,500 to 3,000 men of infantry and as many line cavalry, we have nothing.\n\nThe government must order the generals to wear the uniforms that befit them: this greatly contributes to awakening a certain influence among the young officers. A soldier must have enthusiasm and even a certain air of imposing presence. A general who always appears in a poncho, sometimes even in a brim jacket and a wide-brimmed hat, what influence could he arouse?\n\nIt reminds me of a saying of Colonel Damasceno; he used to say: \"listen, what republic has generals dressing in sackcloth ponchos,\" referring to General Neto, who wore some white ponchos. Could anyone think this is a trifle? On the contrary, it greatly influences the discipline of an army.\n\nI send you the list of items I need for my corps, advising that the swords be straight, because our officers are so accustomed to them that, if others come, they soon toss them away. The same goes for pistols: since these huge pistols appeared, you do not see a single pistol. Giving a pistol to any private is the same as throwing it away; this is because they like the big pistols better. If you order the bands, let them also have wide fringe and be all uniform, otherwise it is money wasted; the tassels should also be matching and reliable. If cloth and lacing for the buglers could come, it would be a fortune. I am going to have from fifteen to twenty cornets for the music band, and there are only three instruments; the general tells me he sent more, however, I wish you to send those I ask for. The letter goes to ex-Lieutenant Ferreira.\n\nSend frankly to one who prides himself on fidelity Your friend and obliged compatriot Serafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nNota bene"
