  "translation": "Here I send you the list I had spoken about. I will pretend that it is a copy of a letter I addressed to another friend. You have seen the limited space offered by a tent for writing, and therefore, due to laziness, I have not transferred it to another paper. Prepare yourself patiently to read such a lengthy jeremiad.\n\nKnow that I have rejoiced greatly with the new appointments. The one for Olivério seems very good to me; the one for Hildebrando very fitting; and the one for Chagas; in short, if the government continues to move in this way, it should always count me among its apologists and defenders.\n\nYou will note that I touch upon some public matters. One of them is the increase that must be given to our infantry and artillery corps, and to push the cavalry corps to their utmost numerical strength.\n\nBelieve me, my friend, that if we do not have at least 2,500 to 3,000 infantry men and as many line cavalry, we have nothing.\n\nThe government should order the generals to wear the uniforms that are appropriate for them: this greatly contributes to awaken certain influence among the junior officers. The military must have enthusiasm and even a certain air of imposure. What influence can a general present in a poncho, sometimes even in a cotton jacket and a large-brimmed hat, exert?\n\nIt reminds me of a saying by Colonel Damasceno; he used to say: \"Look at this republic where the generals go in wool ponchos,\" referring to General Neto, who wore white ponchos. Can anyone think this is a trifle? On the contrary, it greatly affects the discipline of an army.\n\nI am sending you the list of items I need for my corps, noting that the swords should be straight, for our officers are so accustomed that if others come, they will immediately discard them. Likewise, the pistols: after these appeared, one no longer sees a pistol. Giving a pistol to any soldier is the same as throwing it away; this is because they prefer the pistols. If I were to order the bands, let them also have wide fringes and all be pairs, or else it's money wasted; the drums should also be brothers and guarantors. If the cloth and laces for the trumpeters could come, it would be a fortune. I will have fifteen to twenty cornets for the music band, and there are only three instruments; the general tells me that he ordered more, however I wish you to send me those I request. The letter goes to ex-Lieutenant Ferreira."
