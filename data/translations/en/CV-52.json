  "translation": "In accordance with the orders and instructions of the Illustrious Excellent Mr. 1st of this month, at 7 o'clock in the evening, I marched from the Picada camp with 120 troops from the 5th Corps of Cavalry of the National Guard under my command and 24 troops from Major Simas' squadron led by Lieutenant Demétrio and Ensign Claro; and following embarked with the necessary horses on the 3 barges, towed by two war launches, with their garrison and competent crew, I disembarked in Morretes at 11 o'clock at night, and forming the necessary divisions, at one o'clock in the morning I marched against the enemy's positions, cutting through fields and marshes with some difficulty, leaving the enemy's advanced guards behind; and at 5 o'clock in the morning I ambushed my forces in a thicket, which was a quarter league away from the camp called Da Demanda, where the enemy was located, and at 8 o'clock in the day I marched against the enemy, and being attacked, they were completely dispersed; among the rebels captured was the Commander of the Force, Major Duarte Martins Canabarro, brother of David Canabarro, who was severely wounded in an arm, and Lieutenant Francisco Xavier, nephew of Bento Manuel Ribeiro, and ten soldiers; five soldiers and one badly injured sergeant were left dead on the field; we also captured 18 saddled horses, some weaponry, and 80 tame horses, of which I chose fifty that I ordered to be put on the islands, and sixty cattle that the barges were able to carry. From the legality not in Morretes, in good order, 230 infantry commanded by Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, who had brought the steamboat \"Liberal,\" were not needed to operate. All the forces under my command behaved with energy and valor as usual, as did the crews and garrisons of the mentioned war vessels. I withdrew from Morretes between 8 and 9 o'clock at night and arrived safely at the Picada camp at 10 o'clock that same night."
