  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn accordance with the orders and instructions of the Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir on the 1st of the current month, at 7 o'clock in the evening, I marched from the Picada camp with 120 men of the 5th Corps of National Guard Cavalry under my command and 24 men of the squadron of Major Simas commanded by Lieutenant Demétrio and Ensign Claro; and embarking with the appropriate horses on 3 barges, towed by two war launches, with their competent garrison and crew, I disembarked at Morretes at 11 o'clock at night, and forming the necessary divisions, at one hour past midnight I marched towards the enemy positions, cutting through fields and marshes with some difficulty, leaving the enemy's advanced guards to the rear; and at 5 o'clock at dawn I ambushed my forces in a thicket, which was a quarter of a league from the estate called Demanda, where the enemy was located; and at 8 o'clock in the day I marched upon the enemy, and being attacked, they were completely dispersed; captured from the rebels were the Force Commander, Major Duarte Martins Canabarro, brother of David Canabarro, who was severely wounded by a cut on one arm, and Lieutenant Francisco Xavier, nephew of Bento Manuel Ribeiro, and ten soldiers; five soldiers and one sergeant of poor condition were killed on the field; furthermore, we took possession of 18 harnessed horses, some armament and more than 80 tame horses, of which I selected fifty which I ordered to be placed on the islands, and sixty head of cattle that the barges could carry. From the legalist forces at Morretes, in good order, 230 infantry commanded by Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, who had conducted the steamboat \"Liberal,\" were present, and it was not necessary for them to engage. All the forces under my command behaved with energy and customary valor, as did the crews and garrisons of the aforementioned war vessels. I made my withdrawal from Morretes with all at between 8 and 9 o'clock at night and happily arrived at the Picada camp at 10 o'clock of the same night.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency.\n\nPicada Camp, April 3, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Viscount of Castro, Brigadier and Commander of the Garrison of the Capital of the city of Porto Alegre.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Major and interim Commander of the 5th Corps."
