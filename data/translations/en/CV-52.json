  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn accordance with the orders and instructions of the Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir on the 1st of the current month, at 7 o'clock in the evening, I marched from the Picada camp with 120 soldiers of the 5th Corps of Cavalry of the National Guard under my command and 24 soldiers of the squadron of Major Simas commanded by Lieutenant Demétrio and Ensign Claro; and embarking with the appropriate horses on the 3 barges, towed by two war launches, with their competent garrison and crew, I disembarked at Morretes at 11 o'clock at night, and forming the necessary divisions, at one o'clock in the morning I marched upon the enemy's positions, cutting through fields and marshes with some difficulty, leaving the enemy's advanced guards to the rear; and at 5 o'clock in the morning I ambushed my forces in a grove, which was a quarter of a league from the estate called Demanda, where the enemy was; and at 8 o'clock in the day I marched upon the enemy, and being attacked, they were completely dispersed; prisoners taken from the rebels were the Commander of the Force, Major Duarte Martins Canabarro, brother of David Canabarro, who was seriously wounded by a cut on one arm, and Lieutenant Francisco Xavier, nephew of Bento Manuel Ribeiro, and ten soldiers; five soldiers and a sergeant of poor disposition were killed on the field; more were captured, including 18 saddled horses, some armament, and more than 80 tame horses, of which I chose fifty that I ordered to be placed on the islands, and sixty head of cattle that the barges could carry. From the legality at Morretes, in good order, 230 infantry commanded by Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, who had managed the steam barge “Liberal,” were carried, who did not need to be deployed. All the forces under my command behaved with energy and customary valor, as did the crews and garrisons of the mentioned war vessels. I made my withdrawal with everything from Morretes between 8 and 9 o’clock at night, and arrived with happiness at the Picada camp at 10 o’clock the same night.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency\n\nPicada Camp, April 3, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Viscount of Castro, Brigadier and Commander of the Garrison of the Capital city of Porto Alegre.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nInterim Major Commander of the 5th Corps."
