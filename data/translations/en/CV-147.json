  "translation": "On this date, the government ordered the citizen Colonel Pedro Vieira to promote, in addition to Camaquã, a meeting of all able-bodied men to take up arms, in order to position themselves in the place they deem most appropriate, not only to observe the enemy's movements but also to pursue and defeat any group that, during the absence of the Left Division, dares to tread on our territory; consequently, to Your Excellency."
