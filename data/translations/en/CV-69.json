  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nAccording to Your Excellency’s orders and instructions, on the 29th of last month I held the appropriate meetings of the forces and squadrons under my command at the Ponta Rasa detachment, and on the 3rd of the current month, at 5 o’clock in the afternoon, I completed the crossing of all forces and cavalry to the right bank of the Guaíba river; and on the same day, at 6 o’clock in the evening, in order to cut off the enemy’s rear, I marched with 370 cavalrymen and 84 infantrymen—German soldiers enlisted directly—towards the Serra do Erval, which I crossed in three nights, emerging in the so-called Tavares clearings, where the Peace Judge of the rebels José Gonçalves da Silva, brother of their chief Bento Gonçalves da Silva, was arrested. Making the necessary inquiries there, I learned that the rebel forces who had crossed to the left bank of the Camaquã river and those that had gathered had already passed to the right bank of the same river; without delay, I proceeded to the chapel of São João and from there I dispatched, as appropriate, several detachments to diverse locations, not only to gather horses but also to observe and examine the enemy’s intentions, all with orders to join me at the Passo do Cordeiro, where I was proceeding with the largest force; at said pass a rebel, comrade of another rebel officer, was captured; and on the 9th all detachments assembled with one hundred and fifty horses and four more prisoners, one of whom was said to be named Lemos, titled lieutenant, and three soldiers captured by Ensign Fidélis Pais da Silva Feitán. This junction, in view of what I had gathered, having irrefutable certainty that the entire enemy was on the other side of the Camaquã and having been prewarned, I took the measures within my reach, informing on the same day the Lieutenant Colonel João Frederico, commander of the forces that had come from Rio Pardo, so that he would march with the force under his command to cross the Camaquã directly to the Malaquias estate to establish there a point of observation and waiting for any discoveries. Cristal ... at the Passo de Santa Isabel, facing the chapel of Boqueirão, whose crossing I effected on the night of the 9th; and soon I sent out several detachments with instructions to various parts, not only to gather horses, capture rebels and examine enemy passages, all ordered to join me at the Passo de Santa Isabel, facing the chapel of Boqueirão, where I was heading, and where on the 12th we all made junction; and there over three hundred horses were counted as gathered; and if it had not been for a heavy fog of mist from the 11th at midnight, which lasted until ten in the morning of the 12th, which prevented the taking by surprise of over two hundred more horses which the rebels had cornered, and the darkness of the night’s fog did not allow us to surround them, and the day revealed this so they could escape with them; at this point of Santa Isabel, combining my ideas, and seeing that I had already marched over 40 leagues in pursuit of the enemy, who, well warned, had withdrawn to the center, and with no more horses to gather, and seeing that my cavalry had been much worn by violent marches, and having to undertake a long withdrawal, I then decided to go with my force to join the forces coming from Rio Pardo, under Lieutenant Colonel João Frederico, at the designated place in the estate of said Malaquias, where leaving Santa Isabel on the 12th I arrived on the 13th; and upon making the junction, on the same day we began our retreat, recrossing the Camaquã river at the Passo da Armada, all forces marching together to the place called the Cordilheira, from where we separated, theirs heading to Rio Pardo and I directly to the hills of Roque, passing review among the inhabitants of the districts; and from said Cerro do Roque I proceeded on the 20th to Ponta Rasa, arriving on the right bank on the 22nd without any loss, with the aforementioned six prisoners and four hundred and fifty horses gathered, all of which passed to the Ponta Rasa detachment on the left side of the river; and from there the prisoners were sent to Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency. Loyal and Valorous City of Porto Alegre, May 24, 1842. Most Illustrious and Excellent Count of Rio Pardo Francisco Pedro de Abreu. Lieutenant Colonel."
