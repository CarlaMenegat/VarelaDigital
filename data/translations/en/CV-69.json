  "translation": "In accordance with the orders and instructions of Your Excellency, on the 29th of last month, I held the appropriate meetings of the forces and squadrons under my command at the Ponta Rasa detachment. On the 3rd of the current month, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I completed the crossing of all the forces and cavalry to the right bank of the Guaíba River; and on the same day, at 6 o'clock in the afternoon, in order to cut off the enemy's rear, I marched with 370 cavalrymen and 84 infantrymen of German origin directly to the Sierra do Erval, which I crossed in three nights, emerging at the grazing lands called Tavares, where the Justice of the Peace for the rebels, José Gonçalves da Silva, brother of the rebel leader Bento Gonçalves da Silva, was captured. After making the necessary inquiries there, I learned that the rebel forces that had crossed to the left bank of the Camaquã River and those that had already gathered had passed to the right bank of the same river. Without delay, I proceeded to the chapel of São João and from there directed, as was appropriate, several parties to various locations, not only to gather horses but also to observe and examine the enemy's plans, all with orders to join me at the Cordeiro pass, to which I was advancing with a larger force. At this pass, a rebel, a companion of another rebel officer, was captured; and there, on the 9th, all the parties gathered with one hundred and fifty horses and four more prisoners, one of whom was a certain Lemos, titled lieutenant, along with three soldiers captured by Ensign Fidélis Pais da Silva. Given this gathering, and being certain that the entire enemy was on the other side of the Camaquã River, and having been forewarned, I followed the measures at my disposal, writing on the same day, the 9th, to Lieutenant Colonel João Frederico, commander of the forces that had left Rio Pardo, so that he could march with his command across the Camaquã directly to the Malaquias ranch to await and observe whatever might be discovered.\n\nCrystal ... at the Santa Isabel pass, facing the chapel of Boqueirão, whose crossing I carried out on the night of the same day, the 9th; and immediately directed various parties with instructions to different locations, not only to gather horses, capture rebels, and examine the enemy's movements, all with orders to reunite with me at the Santa Isabel pass, facing the chapel of Boqueirão, where I was heading, and where, on the 12th, we all gathered; and there were counted more than three hundred horses collected. If it hadn’t been for a heavy fog from the 11th until midnight, lasting until ten o'clock on the 12th, which prevented us from capturing more than two hundred and some rebels who were cornered, and the darkness of the fog that night did not allow us to surround them, and the day allowed them to escape; at this point at Santa Isabel, combining my ideas, and seeing that I had already marched more than 40 leagues in pursuit of the enemy, who was well prepared and had retreated to the center, and seeing that there were no more horses to gather, and my cavalry being rather exhausted from the violent marches, and having to make a long retreat, I then decided to go with my force to join the forces coming from Rio Pardo, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel João Frederico, at the designated point at the Malaquias ranch, from where I left Santa Isabel on the 12th and arrived on the 13th; and after the joining, on the same day we began our retreat, crossing the Camaquã River again at the Armada pass, all forces moving together to a place called Cordilheira, from where we separated, that one heading to Rio Pardo and I directly to the hills of Roque, making rounds through the residents of the districts; and from the said hill of Roque, I made my way on the 20th to Ponta Rasa, arriving at the right bank on the 22nd without any issues, with the aforementioned six prisoners and four hundred and fifty horses gathered, all of which were transferred to the Ponta Rasa detachment on the left side of the river; and from there the prisoners were sent to Your Excellency."
