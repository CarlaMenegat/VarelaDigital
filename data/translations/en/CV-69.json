  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn accordance with Your Excellency's orders and instructions of the 29th of last month, I held the appropriate meetings of the forces and squadrons under my command at the Ponta Rasa detachment, and on the 3rd of this month, at 5 o’clock in the afternoon, I completed the crossing of all forces and cavalry to the right bank of the Guaíba River; and on the same day, at 6 o’clock in the evening, with the aim of cutting off the enemy’s rear, I marched with 370 cavalrymen and 84 infantrymen, previously engaged German troops, directly to the Serra do Erval, which I crossed in three nights, emerging in the meadows called Tavares, where the Peace Judge of the rebels José Gonçalves da Silva was arrested, brother of the leader of the same, Bento Gonçalves da Silva. Making the necessary inquiries there, I learned that the rebel forces that had crossed to the left bank of the Camaquã River and those that had gathered had already crossed back to the right bank of the same river; without delay I proceeded to the chapel of São João and from there I directed, as was appropriate, several detachments to various places, not only to gather horses but also to observe and examine the enemy’s intentions, all ordered to join me at the Pass of Cordeiro, where I was advancing with the larger force; and at the said pass a rebel comrade of another rebel officer was captured; and there on the 9th all detachments gathered with one hundred and fifty horses and four more prisoners, one of whom was a certain Lemos, designated lieutenant, and three soldiers arrested by Ensign Fidélis Pais da Silva Feitán. This junction, in view of what I had gathered, assured me physically that the entire enemy was on the other side of the Camaquã, and having been forewarned, I took the measures within my reach, informing on the same day the 9th Lieutenant-Colonel João Frederico, commander of the forces that had left Rio Pardo, to march with the forces under his command to cross the Camaquã directly to the Estância do Malaquias to establish a point of wait and observation on what might be discovered. Cristal... at the Pass of Santa Isabel, facing the chapel of Boqueirão, whose crossing I made on the night of the same day 9; and I immediately directed several detachments with instructions, to various parts, not only to gather horses, capture rebels, and examine the enemy’s crossings, all ordered to join me at the Pass of Santa Isabel, facing the chapel of Boqueirão, where I was heading, and where on the 12th we all joined; and there three hundred more horses were counted as gathered; and were it not for a heavy foggy mist from midnight of the 11th lasting until ten o’clock of the 12th, which prevented taking by surprise more than two hundred and so that the rebels had cornered, and the darkness of the mist at night did not allow their enclosure and the day revealed them able to escape with them; at this point of Santa Isabel, combining my thoughts and seeing that I had already marched more than 40 leagues in pursuit of the enemy, who, well warned, had retreated to the center, and there being no more horses to gather, and seeing my cavalry considerably worn by the violent marches, and having to undertake a long withdrawal, I then resolved to go with my force to make junction with the forces coming from Rio Pardo, under Lieutenant-Colonel João Frederico, at the designated point in the estate of said Malaquias, where leaving Santa Isabel on the 12th I arrived on the 13th; and having made the junction, on the same day we began our withdrawal, again crossing the Camaquã River at the Pass of Armada, all forces moving together to the place called Cordilheira, whence we separated, that one going to Rio Pardo and I directly to the Cerros do Roque, passing inspection among the inhabitants of the districts; and from said Cerro do Roque I proceeded on the 20th to Ponta Rasa, arriving on the right bank on the 22nd without any loss, with the aforementioned six prisoners and four hundred and fifty horses gathered, all of which passed to the Ponta Rasa detachment on the left side of the river; and from there the prisoners were sent to Your Excellency. Your Excellency. Your Excellency. Your Excellency. Your Excellency.\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency\n\nLoyal and Valiant City of Porto Alegre, May 24, 1842.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Count of Rio Pardo  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant-Colonel."
