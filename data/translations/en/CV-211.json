  "translation": "Dear Bernardina\n\nFortunately, I have had the opportunity to write to you almost every day, which somewhat eases the longing I constantly have for you and our children. It was only today that I received your letter of the 28th of last month, which accompanied the sugar and flour you sent, and I know you have received the 808 réis from Bresque, and I must also suppose that by now you will be in possession of sixty patacões that I sent you from here. With that I am more at ease, although I still wish for the sums from Tavares, Benito Deve ser the justice of the peace of Jaguarão, killed by a force under the command of Florisbelo de Ávila, from the people of Silva Tavares, and Manuel Gonçalves, to be delivered to you.\n\nBy this bearer, you will send me some papers that are in the drawer of the writing desk where I used to write, in the small drawer beneath the mirror, as well as the response to the attached letter, which you will send to old Sousa by a trustworthy person, so that the said response can come.\n\nOur affairs are proceeding without news and seem stalled, which afflicts me considerably because the most favorable opportunity to overthrow our enemies has been lost. Patience and constancy, for everything will be resolved. I am waiting for Vicente, for whom I sent to bring the slaves who were at Pedras Brancas and at Dores, but if you find someone to take the slaves to Montevideo before him, send them, so that we may begin raising and educating our children. Your parents and siblings are without news; the godmother María José and Quínzio went to Pelotas yesterday because the godfather Joaquim wanted to seek medical treatment there; and all the children stayed at Pedras Altas. I still think that you would do well at Manuel Gonçalves' house, since Félix will take charge of our children's education.\n\nEmbrace them for me, give my regards to all relatives in general, and you receive the heart of Your lover Almeida.\n\nPiratini, June 8, 1837.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. At Señor Luís Vieira's farm, in Chuí."
