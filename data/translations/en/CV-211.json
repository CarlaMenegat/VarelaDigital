  "translation": "Happily, I have been able to write to you almost every day, which somewhat eases the longing I constantly have for you and our children. Just today, I received your letter of the 28th of last month, which accompanied the sugar and flour you sent, and I know you have received the 808 rs. from Bresque, also assuming that by this time you will have in your possession sixty patacões that I sent you from here. With that, I feel more at ease, although I wish the amounts for Tavares be delivered to you; Benito must be the justice of the peace of Jaguarão, killed by a force under the command of Florisbelo de Ávila, from Silva Tavares' people, and Manuel Gonçalves.\n\nBy this messenger, you will send me some papers that are in the drawer of the writing desk where I used to write, in the small drawer, under the mirror, as the reply to the attached letter, which you will send to old Sousa through a secure person, to bring said reply.\n\nOur affairs are going along without news and seem stationary, which greatly troubles me because the most advantageous opportunity we have had to overthrow our enemies has been lost. Patience and perseverance, for everything will be resolved. I am waiting for Vicente, for whom I sent for the slaves who were in Pedras Brancas and Las Dores, but if you find someone who can take the slaves to Montevidéu before him, send them, so we can begin to provide for and educate our children. Your parents and siblings are without news; godmother María José and Quínzio went to Pelotas yesterday because godfather Joaquim wants to receive treatment there; and all the children stayed in Pedras Altas. I still think it would be good for you to stay at Manuel Gonçalves' house, as Félix will take charge of the education of our children."
