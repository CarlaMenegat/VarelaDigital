  "translation": "Dear Bernardina\n\nFortunately, I have had the opportunity to write to you almost every day, which somewhat alleviates the longing I constantly feel for you and our children. Only today did I receive your letter of the 28th of last month that accompanied the sugar and flour you sent, and I know you have received the 808 rs. from Bresque, and I must also suppose that by now you are in possession of sixty patacões that I sent you from here. With that, I am more at ease, yet wishing that the sums from Tavares, Benito (who must be the justice of the peace of Jaguarão, killed by a force under the command of Florisbelo de Ávila, from Silva Tavares’s men), and Manuel Gonçalves are delivered to you.\n\nThrough this courier you shall send me some papers that are in the drawer of the writing desk where I used to write, in its small drawer, under the mirror, also the reply to the enclosed letter, which you will send to old Sousa by a trustworthy person, so that he may bring said reply.\n\nOur affairs are going on without news and as if stalled, which troubles me greatly because the most advantageous opportunity to overthrow our enemies has been lost. Patience and perseverance, as everything will be resolved. I am waiting for Vicente, for whom I sent the slaves that were at Pedras Brancas and at Dores, but if you find anyone who can take the slaves to Montevidéu before he arrives, send them, so that we may have means to raise and educate our children. Your parents and siblings are without news; godmother María José and Quínzio went yesterday to Pelotas because godfather Joaquim wished to seek medical treatment there; and all the children remained in Pedras Altas. I still think that you would be well in Manuel Gonçalves’s house, given that Félix is taking charge of our children’s education.\n\nEmbrace them for me, recommend me to all the relatives in general, and receive the heart of your lover Almeida. Piratini, June 8, 1837.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. At the estate of Senhor Luís Vieira, in Chuí."
