  "translation": "My dear husband of my heart  \nPelotas, February 3, 1836.\n\nI received yours by Mr. Captain Manuel Antunes, which I was very glad of, your health; since I have a bearer for the same, I write to you in this way wishing to take advantage of the bearer in order to inform you that everyone is in perfect health, but longing for your absence, and I even more so, for you well know the esteem I have for your kind company and therefore with the greatest insistence I ask you to do your best to preserve a life which for me is the thing of greatest consideration in this world; and besides this, engrave in your mind that we have children and that your absence would be of great harm to them, therefore caution and more caution; and I remain tranquil in the persuasion that my requests will be attended to.\n\nI have felt quite a lot due to the lack of your news, which I do not know where it comes from, however not being so. Accept many regards from our compadre José Félix, and my parents, and compadre Rolino, as well as our children.\n\nMr. Captain Manuel Antunes has urged the President so that he may go there to take office; it has not been possible to convince him for now because of Ribas and others in proportion as I follow it. Today the people from the coast gather to be ready until the second order of the said Lord.\n\nYour very loving wife of the heart,  \nBernardina\n\nNota bene Sir"
