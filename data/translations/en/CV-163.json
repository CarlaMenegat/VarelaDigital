  "translation": "My dear husband of my heart  \nPelotas, February 3, 1836.\n\nI received yours by Mr. Captain Manuel Antunes, which I greatly appreciated regarding your health; as I have a bearer for this, I likewise write to you, wishing to take advantage of the bearer in order to inform you that everyone is in perfect health, but longing for your absence, and I even more so, for you well know the esteem I have for your kind company, and therefore I most earnestly beg you to endeavor to preserve a life which to me is the thing of greatest importance in this world; and besides this, engrave in your mind that we have children and that your absence would be of great harm to them, therefore caution and more caution; and I remain calm in the persuasion that my pleas will be heeded.\n\nI have greatly felt the lack of your news, which I do not know where it proceeds from, however, since it is not . Accept many regards from our godfather José Félix, and my parents, and godfather Rolino, as well as our children.\n\nMr. Captain Manuel Antunes has urged the President so that I might go there to take possession; it has not been possible to convince him for now because of Ribas and others as I follow it. Today the people from the coast gather to be ready until the second order from the said Lord.\n\nYour most loving wife of the heart,  \nBernardina\n\nNota bene Senhor"
