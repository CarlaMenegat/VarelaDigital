  "translation": "I received your letter through Captain Manuel Antunes, which I greatly appreciated for your health; as I have a messenger to send to you, I write this to take advantage of the opportunity to inform you that everyone is in perfect health, but missing you in your absence, and I even more so, for you well know the esteem I have for your amiable company. Therefore, I earnestly ask you to take care of a life that is, for me, the most important thing in this world; and besides this, keep in your thoughts that we have children and that your absence would be of great harm to them, so caution and more caution; and I remain calm in the persuasion that my pleas will be attended to.\n\nI have greatly missed your news, and I do not know where this is coming from, but it is not . Accept many regards from our compadre José Félix, as well as from my parents, and compadre Rolino, and our children.\n\nCaptain Manuel Antunes has been urging the President to take possession; it has not been possible to convince him for now because of Ribas and others as far as I follow. Today, the people from the coast are gathering to be ready until further notice from the said Lord."
