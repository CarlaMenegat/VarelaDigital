  "translation": "Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu wants discounts on rights due to what the State owes him, and so that the provisions regarding payments are not misleading, I ask you to tell me the total amount owed to him by the State; also the documents by which this account is justified, to see what is in the circumstances of being paid promptly, in accordance with the same opinion and circular.\n\nWhen Abreu was here, he presented some documents regarding cattle taken for the municipality's forces, and he took them because they lacked some requirements; I do not know the total amount. He still owes a note that he passed at the Coletoria do Erval, recently presented by the collector there."
