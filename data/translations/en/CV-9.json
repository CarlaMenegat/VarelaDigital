  "translation": "Friend and Lord\n\nAntônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu wants discounts on duties on account of what the State owes him and to prevent the provisions made regarding payments from being frustrated, I beg you to tell me what is the total amount that the State owes him; also the documents by which this account was justified, to see what is in a position to be paid promptly, in accordance with the same opinion and circular.\n\nYour friend and compatriot Fontoura\n\nWhen Abreu was here, he presented some documents of cattle taken from him for the supply of forces, and he took them back because some questions were missing in them; I do not know their amount; he still owes a note that was drawn up at the Erval Collection Office, recently presented by the collector there.\n\nFrom Your Excellency Martins\n\nAbreu brought the documents back; therefore they were not recorded. The amount that is found debited by the Erval Collection Office, I do not recall what it is; and thus he is further debited with another amount, which he received by order of the Ministry of Finance through the Collection Office under his charge, when Collector.\n\nAnnexed to document CV-6."
