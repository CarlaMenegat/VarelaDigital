  "translation": "Friend and Lord\n\nAntônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu wants discounts on rights due to what the State owes him and so that the provisions made about payments are not disappointed, I beg you to tell me the total amount the State owes him; also the documents by which this account was justified, to see what is in the circumstances to be paid promptly, in accordance with the same opinion and circular.\n\nYour friend and compatriot Fontoura\n\nWhen Abreu was here, he presented some documents of cattle taken from him for the supply of forces, and he took them back because some requirements were missing; I do not know the amount they amounted to; he still owes a bill of exchange he issued at the Erval Collection Office, recently presented by the collector from there.\n\nFrom Your Excellency Martins\n\nAbreu brought the documents again; therefore they were not recorded. The amount found debited at the Erval Collection Office I do not recall; and so he also has another amount debited to him, which he received by order of the Ministry of Finance through the Collection Office under his charge, when he was Collector.\n\nAnnexed to document CV-6."
