  "translation": "In the mail yesterday, I did not receive your letter, which has greatly annoyed me, particularly because I dreamt of seeing you crying. Our tasks, instead of diminishing, are increasing, and you can imagine how much this bothers me, coming for twelve days.\n\nIf my tasks call me to your arms, the Fatherland orders that I do not leave: God help me!!! The camaraderie, with the denial of Araújo Ribeiro's possession, has lost heart all at once, and for that reason, they invent nonsense; but do not have the slightest fear that everything is moving towards a single end, and the Fatherland will be saved."
