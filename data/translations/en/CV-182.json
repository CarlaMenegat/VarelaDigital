  "translation": "My beloved wife  \nPorto Alegre, December 12, 1835.\n\nBy yesterday's mail I did not receive a letter from you, which has greatly distressed me, particularly because I dreamed of seeing you cry. Our troubles, instead of lessening, increase, and you can imagine how much this troubles me, after twelve days.\n\nIf my duties call me to your arms, the Fatherland orders me not to leave it: God help me!!! The camaruruada, with the denial of the possession of Araújo Ribeiro, has become disheartened once and for all, and for that reason they invent nonsense; but you need have no slightest fear that everything is moving toward one sole end, and the Fatherland will be saved.\n\nRegards to all our people and embraces to the halves of our souls. On the holy days, you shall have from there your husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nTo Mrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida  \nPelotas."
