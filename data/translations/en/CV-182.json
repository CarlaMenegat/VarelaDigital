  "translation": "My beloved wife  \nPorto Alegre, December 12, 1835.\n\nBy yesterday’s mail I did not receive a letter from you, which has greatly distressed me, especially since I dreamed I saw you crying. Our troubles, instead of lessening, increase, and you can imagine how much this distresses me, having been away for twelve days.\n\nIf my duties call me to your arms, the Fatherland commands that I do not leave it: may God help me!!! The camaruruada, with the denial of Araújo Ribeiro’s office, was once and for all discouraged, and for that reason they invent absurdities; but do not have the slightest fear that everything is moving toward one end, and the Fatherland will be saved.\n\nRegards to all our people and embraces to the halves of our souls. On the holy days you will have from there your husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
