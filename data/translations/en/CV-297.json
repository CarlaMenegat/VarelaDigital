  "translation": "As Your Excellency Piratini, who ordered to arrange in Montevidéu the rest of my butcher slaves, to send with their proceeds to Assis 2:000$000, to Zambeccari 1:000$000, to our prisoners 1:000$000, payment for the Typography 3:852$800 in capital and prizes due until last December, to Ré 1:663$200 for payment of paper and medicines owed to the State, to Deal 384$000 on behalf of the same State, 480$ as part of the amount for the medicines purchased for the same State from Dr. Bocquin; I also inform you that despite considering such slaves sold and their proceeds distributed, I will today send a counter-order, not for the sale of the slaves, because I count them as lost if Fructo continues in the oppression of the Easterners, but rather for their product, given the direction our affairs have taken in recent days. \n\nYour Excellency"
