  "translation": "My Most Excellent Sir\n\nAs Your Excellency at Piratini commanded to dispose in Montevideo of the remainder of my slaves butchers, to with their amount send to Assis 2:000$000, to Zambeccari 1:000$000, to our prisoners 1:000$000, payment of the Printing House 3:852$800 of capital and premiums due until last December, to Ré 1:663$200 for payment of paper and medicines that the State owes him, to Deal 384$000 on account of the same State, 480$ part of the amount of medicines that for the same State were purchased from Dr. Bocquin; now I also inform that despite considering such slaves as sold and their amount distributed, I will send today a counter-order, not of the sale of the slaves, because I reckon them lost if Fructo continues in the oppression of the Orientals, but rather of their proceeds, given the direction our affairs have taken in recent days.\n\nYour Excellency\n\nFrom Your Excellency's sincere and obliged friend Almeida S.C., March 31, 1839"
