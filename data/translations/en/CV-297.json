  "translation": "My Most Excellent Sir\n\nAs Your Excellency Piratini, who commanded to dispose in Montevideo of the rest of my butcher slaves, to with their amount send to Assis 2:000$000, to Zambeccari 1:000$000, to our prisoners 1:000$000, payment of the Printing House 3:852$800 of capital and premiums due until last December, to Ré 1:663$200 for payment of paper and medicines that the State owes him, to Deal 384$000 on account of the same State, 480$ part of the amount for medicines purchased for the same State from Dr. Bocquin; now I also inform that although I consider such slaves sold and their amount distributed, I will send today an order to countermand, not of the sale of the slaves, because I count on them lost if Fructo continues under the oppression of the Orientals, but rather of their product, seeing the direction our affairs have taken these past days.\n\nYour Excellency\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s sincere and obliged friend Almeida  \nS.C., March 31, 1839"
