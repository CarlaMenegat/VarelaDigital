  "translation": "Regarding the contents of your letter of the 4th of this month, the Government instructs me to inform you that when it gave the order to Captain Pedro Rodrigues de Quevedo to manage slaves and promote the tannery under his responsibility, it was under the impression that such an establishment was outside the district that was entrusted to Your Honor. \n\nGod preserve Your Honor."
