  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nBy virtue of Your Excellency's orders of the 27th of last month, at 7 o'clock in the evening, with eighty cavalrymen with their officers and forty horses, and over one hundred rank and file of the 8th Battalion, under the command of Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, on the steamship \"Liberal,\" and two animal ferry boats, and a gunboat under the command of 1st Lieutenant Rodrigo Antônio de Lamare.\n\nProceeding to the town of Triunfo and observing Your Excellency's instructions concerning the town of Triunfo from the sea side; suddenly advancing by land I encountered a rebel detachment commanded by a Lieutenant-Colonel Morais; it was defeated by the loyalists, the said commander escaping, leaving behind a saddled horse, a bag, and clothing; prisoners taken included a surgeon, a mulatto, and two blacks, of whom I believe one is a captive; casualties were a lieutenant from the Cachoeira area named Damasceno and two black lancers; a Lieutenant Caldeira, or Juca Custódio, was shot in the chest; among the loyalists there was no noteworthy event. We captured from the rebels some sixty horses, some saddled and some arms; then immediately proceeding by land to the town of Triunfo, I found nothing, as the enemy of that district, out of fear, had withdrawn with everything; I seized some cattle, which I immediately sent across, and horses to the Paciência islet, and all were well embarked near the mouth of the Ratos stream.\n\nAll officers, non-commissioned officers, soldiers, and sea and land crews of whom\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency. Porto Alegre, March 1, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nMajor."
