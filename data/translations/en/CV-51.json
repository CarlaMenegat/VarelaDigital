  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nBy virtue of the orders of Your Excellency on the 27th of last month, at 7 o'clock in the evening, with eighty cavalrymen with their officers and forty horses, and over one hundred enlisted men of the 8th Battalion, under the command of Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, on the steamship \"Liberal,\" and two animal ferry boats, and a gunboat under the command of 1st Lieutenant Rodrigo Antônio de Lamare.\n\nAnd proceeding to the town of Triunfo and observing the instructions of Your Excellency concerning Triunfo from the sea side; suddenly traveling by land I encountered a rebel detachment commanded by a Lieutenant-Colonel Morais; it was defeated by the loyalists, with the said commander escaping, leaving behind a saddled horse, bag, and clothing; a surgeon, a mulatto, and two black men were captured, one of whom I believe to be a slave; killed were a lieutenant from the region of Cachoeira named Damasceno and two black lancers; and a Lieutenant Caldeira, or Juca Custódio, was wounded in the torso; among the loyalists there was nothing unusual. In our possession from the rebels were sixty or so horses, some pack animals, and some weaponry; and then proceeding immediately to the town of Triunfo by land, I found nothing, because the enemy in that district, out of fear, had withdrawn with all; I seized some cattle, which I immediately transferred, and horses to the island of Paciência, and all were well embarked near the mouth of Arroio dos Ratos.\n\nAll the officers and junior officers and soldiers and crews of sea and land of whom\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nPorto Alegre, 1st of March, 1839  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.  \nMajor."
