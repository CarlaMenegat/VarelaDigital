  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nBy virtue of Your Excellency's orders of the 27th of last month, at 7 o'clock in the afternoon, with eighty cavalrymen with their officers and forty horses, and more than one hundred rank and file of the 8th Battalion, under the command of Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, on the steam barge “Liberal”, and two barges for transporting animals, and a gunboat under the command of 1st Lieutenant Rodrigo Antônio de Lamare.\n\nAnd proceeding to the village of Triunfo and observing Your Excellency’s instructions for the village of Triunfo from the sea side; suddenly proceeding by land, I encountered a rebel detachment commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel Morais; it was defeated by the loyalists, the said commander escaping, leaving behind a saddled horse, bag and clothing; prisoners were taken, including a surgeon, a mulatto and two negroes, and I think one of them is a captive; killed were a lieutenant from the region of Cachoeira named Damasceno and two negro lancers; and a Lieutenant Caldeira, or Juca Custódio, was shot in the torso; for the loyalists there was no news. Sixty or so horses, some saddles and some armament were taken from the rebels; and then immediately proceeding by land to the village of Triunfo, I found nothing, because the enemy from that district, out of fear, had withdrawn with everything; I took some cattle, which I promptly had moved, and horses to the Island of Paciência, and with everything well embarked near the mouth of the Arroio dos Ratos.\n\nAll the officers and junior officers and soldiers and crews of sea and land of whom\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nPorto Alegre, 1st of March, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.  \nMajor."
