  "translation": "My late Bernardina Bordo, October 16, 1835.\n\nIn possession of your precious letter from yesterday, I thank heaven for having given you the strength to endure the blow that fate has dealt us; and again I implore you to the strictest conformity and perseverance in the labors of this world, because in no other way can the obstacles that surround us be overcome. I truly feel the direction that public opinion has taken regarding me, judging me a criminal and imputing to me all that heated and malevolent ideas have suggested to them; but all this is nothing compared to your afflictions, which is especially what weighs me down. And if you esteem me and want to see me happy, even in the presence of death, make sure that I know you live peacefully and attending to the education of our children. Consider that others have been in a condition even more desperate than ours, and that by constant resignation to the decrees of providence they have overcome difficulties that seemed insurmountable, and were later restored to the position they had lost. I do not complain about anyone, nor do I seek the slightest revenge, and only wish to remove myself with horror from everything that binds me to men. Only thus will I live content in the midst of my beloved family.\n\nI was also informed of the conduct of our creditors and I am not surprised: they do what was to be expected. And if it were not for the time and the ends that I perceive in this, I would gladly give them everything, since living as I have lived, any means of subsistence would be much more favorable to me, sparing you the distress in which you live, etc.; but that they want to take advantage of my absence to do with my house the same as they did with João José Gomes' is what I cannot bear, and I order that an opposition be made to such a vile and harmful handling.\n\nHowever, if they carry out a very premeditated plan, do not give yourself over to despair, for God abandons no one. I already knew this expedient, which they sweetened by leaving you 10% and even promoting a subscription; but I immediately distrusted such fortune, such generosity, from the one who… etc… In short, concerning this I am writing to our friend Chaves and to cousin Cipriano, and I expect they will do what they can for our benefit. I still persist in the project.\n\nIn another letter I will be more extensive. Greetings to our children and visits to all our people, receiving from you the heart of Your husband from the heart Almeida.\n\npost scriptum Send me tomorrow the following: Political Economy, Social Contract, Beccaria or “Treatise on Crimes and Punishments,” Works of Telinho Elípio, black silk stockings, 1 barrel of tongues, 1 ditto of meat, 1 throat for syringe. And let João separate and keep all Barros’ accounts, the Commission’s opinion on the concordat, and all official letters and papers not pertaining to the house’s business. Let our friend Chaves and cousin Cipriano send me letters of recommendation for Rio; and cousin Cipriano send me some money, if he can, in Rio.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
