  "translation": "Upon receiving your esteemed letter from yesterday, I thank heaven for giving you the strength to endure the blow that fortune has dealt us; and I again implore you to maintain the utmost conformity and constancy in the labors of this world, for there is no other way to overcome the obstacles that surround us. I truly feel the shift that public opinion has taken regarding me, deeming me a criminal and attributing to me everything that heated and malicious ideas have suggested to them; but all this is nothing compared to your afflictions, which is above all what weighs heavily on me. And if you care for me and wish to see me content, even in the presence of death, let it be known to me that you live peacefully and are taking care of the education of our children. Consider that others have been in an even more desperate situation than ours, and that through constant resignation to the decrees of providence, they have overcome difficulties that seemed insurmountable and were later restored to the position they had lost. I do not complain of anyone, nor do I seek even the slightest revenge, but only to withdraw with horror from everything that ties me to men. Only in this way will I live content in the midst of my beloved family.\n\nI have also been informed of our creditors' actions and I am not surprised: they are doing what was to be expected. And if it weren't for the circumstances and the ends that I foresee in this, I would gladly hand over everything to them, as living as I have been living, any means of subsistence would be far more favorable for me, sparing you the distress in which you live, etc.; but for them to take advantage of my absence to do with my house what they did with João José Gomes’, that I cannot tolerate, and I order that they oppose such a vile and harmful maneuver.\n\nHowever, should they carry out a very premeditated plan, do not give in to despair, for God does not abandon anyone. I was already aware of this scheme, which they sweetened by leaving you 10% and even proposing a subscription; but I immediately suspected such fortune, such generosity, from someone to whom… etc. In short, I am writing about this to my friend Chaves and to cousin Cipriano, and I am sure they will do what they can for our benefit. I still persist in the plan.\n\nSend me the following tomorrow:\n\nAnd let João separate and keep all the accounts from Barros, the commission's opinion on the concordat, and all the official documents and papers not pertaining to the business of the house.\n\nHave friend Chaves and cousin Cipriano send me a letter of recommendation for Rio; and cousin Cipriano should send me some money, if possible, in Rio."
