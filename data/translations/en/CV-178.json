  "translation": "My late Bernardina Bordo, October 16, 1835.\n\nIn possession of your valuable letter from yesterday, I thank heaven for having given you the strength to endure the blow that fate has dealt us; and again I implore you for the strictest submission and constancy in the labors of this world, for in no other way can we overcome the obstacles that surround us. I truly feel the direction public opinion has taken regarding me, judging me as a criminal and attributing to me all that hot-headed and malevolent ideas have suggested; but all this is nothing compared to your afflictions, which is above all what burdens me. And if you esteem me and wish to see me content, even in the presence of death, make sure that I know you live peacefully and tending to the education of our children. Consider that others have been in an even more desperate condition than ours, and that by constant resignation to the decrees of providence they have overcome difficulties that seemed insurmountable, and were then restored to the position they had lost. I do not complain about anyone, nor do I seek the smallest revenge, but only withdraw with horror from everything that ties me to men. Only thus will I live content in the midst of my beloved family.\n\nI was also informed of the conduct of our creditors and I am not surprised at all: they do what was to be expected. And if it were not for the time and ends that I see in this, I would gladly give them everything, since living as I have lived, any means of subsistence would be much more propitious for me, sparing you the distress in which you live, etc.; but for them to seek to take advantage of my absence to do with my house as they did with that of João José Gomes, that is something I cannot endure, and I order that they oppose such a vile and harmful maneuver.\n\nHowever, if they carry out a very premeditated plan, do not give yourself over to despair, for God abandons no one. I already knew of this expedient, which they sweetened for me by leaving you 10% and even promoting a subscription; but from the outset I distrusted so much fortune, so much generosity, with the one who… etc… In short, on this matter I am writing to friend Chaves and cousin Cipriano, and I am sure they will do what they can for our benefit. I persist still in the project.\n\nIn another letter I will be more extensive. Kisses to our children and regards to all our people, receiving the heart of Your husband from the heart Almeida.\n\npost scriptum Send me tomorrow the following: Political Economy Social Contract Beccaria or “Treatise on Crimes and Punishments” Works by Telinho Elípio Black silk stockings 1 barrel of tongues 1 portion of meat 1 syringe throat And João should separate and keep all Barros’s accounts, the Commission’s opinion on the concordat, and all official papers and documents not pertaining to the house business. Friend Chaves and cousin Cipriano should send me letters of recommendation to Rio; and cousin Cipriano should send me some money, if he can, in Rio.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
