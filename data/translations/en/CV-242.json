  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, May 23, 1838.\n\nWith the shipment of the horses to Mr. Captain Zeferino, just now, three in the afternoon, I can dispatch José. By him I send one arroba of herbs, and in the first cart that offers itself for that I will send more.\n\nAlso goes the medicine for Epaminondas, to whom you should apply continuous baths of mallow, milk, and water, and you will avoid all heavy food and drink, as well as making him not cry so as not to provoke bleeding. As for Aristides, the same previously recommended should be done, and it will be nothing as I hope in God. No medicines go for Mariana’s son because you did not say what the symptoms of the illness are; in the end, only a load of patience can save us.\n\nThe planned invasion on this point evaporated, thanks to Providence; however, I remain vigilant, and do not have the slightest worry for me. The troops from Rio Pardo have not yet arrived; the President likewise, and I am desperate to be free from the troubles of spirit that have quite distressed me, so much so that anxiously I wish to be found anywhere in the Eastern State, although also risky, for I am already lacking patience.\n\nAlways send me word how the children are doing, whom you will embrace for me. Regards to your parents, Chiquinha, José Rodrigues, his wife, godfather Joaquim and his wife; and you receive the heart of Your Almeida.\n\nLady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Bom Retiro, at the farm of Mr. José Rodrigues Chaves."
