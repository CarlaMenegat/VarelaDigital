  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, May 23, 1838.\n\nWith the dispatch of the horses to Captain Zeferino, just now, three in the afternoon, I can send off José. By him I send a arroba of herbs, and on the first cart that is available for that I will send more.\n\nAlso going is the medicine for Epaminondas, to whom you should apply continuous baths of mallow, milk, and water, and you will avoid all heavy food and drink, as well as not crying so as not to provoke the blood. As for Aristides, the same previously recommended should be done, which will not be anything serious, as I hope in God. No medicines are sent for Mariana’s child for not having told which the symptoms of the illness are; in short, only a load of patience can help us.\n\nThe invasion planned against this point has evaporated, thanks to providence; nevertheless, I remain vigilant, and you should have not the slightest worry regarding me. The troops from Rio Pardo have not yet arrived; the President likewise, and I am desperate to be free from the worries of mind which have greatly troubled me, so much that anxiously I wish to be seen in any corner of the Eastern State, although also risky, for I already lack patience.\n\nAlways tell me how the children are doing, whom you will embrace for me. Regards to your parents, Chiquinha, José Rodrigues, his wife, godfather Joaquim and his wife; and you receive the heart of Your Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Bom Retiro, at the farm of Mr. José Rodrigues Chaves."
