  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nDespite what was ordered to you by the circular dated yesterday, addressed to all chiefs of police, I must add that your orders in this regard must be final, deploying all energy against those who, without just cause, do not wish to respond to the call of the Fatherland in the present crisis, holding them responsible to the government for the neglect and weakness with which they behave, and sending those most neglectful in carrying out their orders, detained, to this capital.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nSecretary of War and Navy Affairs in Caçapava, December 20, 1839.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães, Chief of Police of the Boqueirão Department.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nLetter from the Most Excellent Minister of War dated December 20, received on the 27th of the same month.  \nPresidency Secretariat of the Republic\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães, Chief of Police of the Boqueirão Department.  \nFrom the Ministry of War."
