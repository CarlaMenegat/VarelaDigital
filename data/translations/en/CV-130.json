  "translation": "Despite what was ordered by the circular that was sent yesterday to all police chiefs, I must add that your orders regarding this matter must be definitive, exerting all energy against those who, without just cause, do not wish to respond to the call of the Fatherland in this current crisis, holding them accountable to the government for the negligence and weakness with which they behave, and sending the most negligent in fulfilling their orders imprisoned to this capital."
