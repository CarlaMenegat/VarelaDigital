  "translation": "It was a complete satisfaction for me to receive the highly appreciated letter from Your Excellency dated June 21 of last year, and, in virtue of what it demands, I enclose a copy of the responses given by the Government of the Republic of Rio-Grandense and by its Generals David Canabarro and João Antônio da Silveira on the occasion of the invitation made by Baron of Caxias for the proposal of the bases upon which the cessation of the war that was then being waged against the Empire would be established. As for the peoples of Japeju and São Tomé, my father-in-law says they belong to the Missions to the west of Uruguay, and they are situated on the right bank of this river. I hope that in this way the demand of Your Excellency is satisfied.\n\nMy son Antônio Pedroso de Albuquerque is the bearer of this letter; he is going to São Paulo to finalize his law degree, and since it is difficult to meet with Your Excellency."
