As to the peoples of Japeju and São Tomé, my father-in-law says they belong to the Missions west of Uruguay, and are located on the right bank of this river. I shall esteem that in this way the request of Your Excellency is satisfied.\n\nYour Excellency\n\nYour Excellency\n\nYour Excellency\n\nMy son Antônio Pedroso de Albuquerque is the bearer of this; he is going to São Paulo to complete his law degree there, and as it is difficult to meet with Your Excellency\n\nYour Excellency\n\nJosé Pedroso de Albuquerque.\n\nAlegrete, September 16, 1860  \nFrom Mr. José Pedroso de Albuquerque.  \nReceived on September 26, 1860.  \nAnswered on September 26, 1860."
