I hope that, in this way, the requirement of Your Excellency will be satisfied.\n\nYour Excellency\n\nMy son Antônio Pedroso de Albuquerque is the bearer of this letter; he proceeds to São Paulo to finalize his law degree, and since it is difficult to meet with Your Excellency\n\nYour Excellency\n\nJosé Pedroso de Albuquerque.\n\nAlegrete, September 16, 1860\n\nFrom Senhor José Pedroso de Albuquerque.\n\nReceived on September 26, 1860.\n\nAnswered on September 26, 1860."
