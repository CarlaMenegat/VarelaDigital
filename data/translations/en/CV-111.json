When Your Excellencies, the legal cause was in its most delicate crisis; when all the chiefs found themselves in the harsh necessity either to emigrate to the neighboring provinces or into the fortified places; when, finally, the campaign was entirely in the hands of the rebels, and there was no slightest hope of resources; it was in this same period that the Petitioner, assisted by many benevolent citizens, made a formal opposition to the anarchists, with whom he maintained continued guerrilla warfare and debates always honorable for legality for a period of 3 months, until the Excellent Sir Barreto, tired of suffering, appeared on the field and came to give soul—hope—to the legalists, marching at the head of 500 men that the Petitioner had in various points of his responsibility, enduring a thousand sacrifices to oppose them; but before this experienced General had time to recognize the terrain, the enemy and the force he commanded, and to provide for the scarcity of armaments and ammunition which existed, we were attacked by an anarchist force commanded by Bento Manuel Ribeiro of 700 men, on the 7th of July of the current year, a day on which we had already suffered many desertions and a horrible betrayal committed by Evaristo dos Santos Robalo, who commanded a squadron that did not show up, it being impossible to replace him, for which at São Gabriel (being the only officer to whom this happened), where he remained until a legal force entered that place, commanded by Ensign Juca Cipriano, the Petitioner asked him for assistance of horses and men, and with 6 men he brought in his company, and blacks and peasants he carried, attacked on his march towards Cima da Serra a party of anarchists who were at Campestres, commanded by Lieutenant Corporal Juca, and breaking it up took two horses and saddlery from the enemy, and had the satisfaction of presenting himself to the same Excellent Sir Barreto on the 1st of October, when that same gentleman was already promoting the gathering which, seconded by the Petitioner and other citizens, reached the number of 400 men, at the head of whom he marched to this point, suffering along the way some desertions; he had the glory of accompanying the same Excellent Sir, as commander of that brigade which today is encamped at Picada; all of which is evident to the illustrious Commission.\n\nThe Petitioner, Your Excellencies, could well have demonstrated, or will be able to demonstrate to your views, that suffering from a chronic and terrible illness so as to excuse himself from service, he did not hesitate; but, despising life to come to the demands of the fatherland, at a time when he could not be noticed without injustice, at a time when all were ecstatically engaged, if you did not know, without doubt such circumstances will not escape your perspicacity. You, gentlemen, are all witnesses to this report, since all these facts were committed openly in the Province and without doubt would have come to your knowledge those that you did not witness. I could, gentlemen, present everything well documented; however, having them (the documents), being some 100 leagues from the place where they are, and the access obstructed by the enemy? terrified by the horrible betrayal he suffered, on the contrary he sought to perform the most relevant and valuable services which are of public notoriety and are proven by the attached documents; and many others could be presented if it were not for the distance of more than 100 leagues where they are, the traffic being obstructed by the enemy.\n\nBesides what has been exposed, it remains for the Petitioner to inform and consider to His Imperial Majesty that having had no time to establish himself and seek means of subsistence for his family, the Petitioner has moreover been burdened with great expenses, indispensable in the current crisis, to make and maintain good gatherings of men as those he has made. Verified by official letters from the Excellent former Presidents José de Araújo, Chagas, Antero, Bento Manuel, Marshal Barreto, Brigadier Carneiro and other chiefs of whom the Petitioner can present the most flattering praises and thanks on behalf of the fatherland.\n\nThe Petitioner is poor, has a wife and 5 children to support and it is for this reason that feeling himself deserving that a pension be granted to him, he thus requests it, demanding from your righteousness that weighing the services rendered by the Petitioner on the scale of justice, you may grant him, by means of your respectable information, the grace that he may be deemed worthy of, following the example of others who have rendered equal or perhaps fewer services, and have already been remunerated with pensions, and for that reason he expects equal reward and…\n\nRequest for Mercy\n\nNota Bene Porto Alegre, and we defeated them and, afterwards, at Rio Pardo.\n\nAntônio de Melo e Albuquerque\n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho.
