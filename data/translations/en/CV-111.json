  "translation": "Petition (fragmentary)\n\n… that had to prevail. When the Excellencies, the legal cause was in the most delicate crisis; when all the leaders found themselves in the harsh necessity either to emigrate to the neighboring provinces or inside the fortified places; when, finally, the campaign was wholly in the hands of the rebels, and there was no slightest hope of resources; it was in this very period that the Petitioner, helped by many benevolent citizens, made a formal opposition to the anarchists, with whom he maintained continued guerrilla warfare and controversies always honorable for legality for a period of 3 months, until the Most Excellent Sir Barreto, tired of suffering, presented himself in the field and came to give soul — hope — to the legalists, marching with a thousand sacrifices to oppose at the head of 500 men that the Petitioner had in the various points of his responsibility; but before this experienced General had time to recognize the terrain, the enemy and the force he commanded, and to provide for the scarcity of armaments and ammunition that there was, we were attacked by an anarchist force under the command of Bento Manuel Ribeiro of 700 men, on the 7th of July of the current year, a day on which we had already suffered many desertions and a horrible betrayal made by Evaristo dos Santos Robalo, who commanded a squadron that did not go, it being impossible to put him in his place, on which São Gabriel (being the only officer to whom this happened), where he remained until a legal force commanded by Ensign Juca Cipriano entered that place, the Petitioner asked him for assistance of horses and men, and with 6 men whom he brought in his company, and blacks and peasants that he carried, he attacked on his march to Cima da Serra a detachment of anarchists that was at the Campestres, commanded by Lieutenant Corporal Juca, and by destroying it took two horses and harnesses from the enemy, and had the satisfaction of presenting himself before the same Most Excellent Sir Barreto on the 1st of October, when the same lord was already promoting the assembly which, seconded by the Petitioner and other citizens, reached the number of 400 men, at the head of whom he marched to this point, suffering on the way some desertions; he had the glory of accompanying the same Most Excellent Sir, in the capacity of commander of that brigade which today is encamped at Picada; all of which is evident to the illustrious Commission. The Petitioner Honorable Sirs, could well have made or will be able to make it clear to your views that suffering to excuse himself from service, a chronic and fearsome illness, he did not hesitate: but despising life to attend to the demands of the homeland, at a time when he could not be noticed without injustice, at a time when all were ecstatic, if they did not recognize that without doubt such circumstances would not escape your perspicacity. You, gentlemen, are all witnesses of this report, since all these facts were performed in the face of the Province and which, without doubt, would have reached your knowledge those which you did not witness. I could, gentlemen, present to you all well documented; however, as to having them (the documents), being at a distance of nearly 100 leagues from the place where they are, and the traffic obstructed by the enemy? terrified by the horrible betrayal he suffered, on the contrary he sought to do the most relevant and valuable services which are of public notoriety, and proven by the documents attached; and many others I could present if it were not for the distance of more than 100 leagues in which they are, the traffic being hindered by the enemy. Besides what has been said, the Petitioner remains to inform you to consider before His Most Illustrious Majesty that not having had time to establish his settlement and seek means of subsistence for his family, he has, moreover, been overburdened with great expenses, indispensable in the current crisis, in order to make and maintain good assemblies of men such as those he has formed. Proven with official letters from the Most Excellent ex-Presidents José de Araújo, Chagas, Antero, Bento Manuel, Marshal Barreto, Brigadier Carneiro and other chiefs from whom the Petitioner can present the most flattering praises and thanks in the name of the homeland. The Petitioner is poor, has a wife and 5 children to support and it is for this reason that, considering himself deserving, he requests that a pension be granted to him, demanding from your rectitude that weighing on the scales of justice the services rendered by the Petitioner, you provide him, by means of your respectable information, the grace which he may become worthy of, following the example of others who have rendered services equal or perhaps lesser, and have already been rewarded with pensions and therefore expects equal reward and…\n\nPetition for Grace\n\nNota Bene Porto Alegre, and we defeated them and, subsequently, Rio Pardo.\n\nAntônio de Melo e Albuquerque\n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho.
