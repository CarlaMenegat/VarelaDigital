  "translation": "… that had to be conquered. When the Excellency Lords were facing the legal cause at its most delicate crisis; when all the leaders found themselves in the dire need to either emigrate to neighboring provinces or retreat into fortified strongholds; when, finally, the campaign was entirely in the hands of the rebels, and there was not the slightest hope for resources; it was during this very period that the Supplicant, aided by many benevolent citizens, formally opposed the anarchists, with whom he maintained continuous guerrillas and polemics always honorable to legality for a time of 3 months, until the Most Excellent Lord Barreto, tired of suffering, presented himself in the field and came to give spirit—hope—to the legalists, marching alongside a thousand sacrifices to face 500 men that the Supplicant had at various points of his responsibility; but before this experienced General had time to recognize the terrain, the enemy, and the force he commanded, and to arrange for the shortage of arms and ammunition that there was, we were attacked by an anarchist force under the command of Bento Manuel Ribeiro of 700 men, on the day of July 7 of this year, the day on which we had already suffered many desertions and a horrific betrayal committed by Evaristo dos Santos Robalo, who commanded a squadron that could not be replaced, as it was not possible to put him in his place, for which the São Gabriel (being the only officer to whom this happened), remained until a legal force entered that place, commanded by the Lieutenant Juca Cipriano, the Supplicant asked him for help with horses and men, and with 6 men he brought with him, and blacks and peasants he led, attacked in his march towards Cima da Serra a group of anarchists that was in the Campestres, commanded by the Corporal Juca, and crushing them, took two horses and tack from the enemy, and had the satisfaction of presenting himself to the Most Excellent Lord Barreto on October 1, when the same lord was already promoting a gathering that, supported by the Supplicant and other citizens, reached the number of 400 men, leading the way as they marched to this point, suffering along the way some desertions; he had the glory of accompanying the same Most Excellent Lord, in the capacity of commander of that brigade which is now camped at Picada; all of which is clear to the illustrious Commission. The Supplicant, Excellency Lords, could well have demonstrated before you that suffering to excuse himself from service, a chronic and fearsome ailment, he did not hesitate: but disregarding life to respond to the demands of the homeland, at a time when he could not be noticed without injustice, at a time when all the ecstatic, if they did not know, should not, without a doubt, escape your insight to such circumstances. You, gentlemen, are all witnesses to this report, as all these facts were committed in the face of the Province and that, without a doubt, would reach your knowledge those that you did not witness. I could, gentlemen, present everything well documented; however, since we are nearly 100 leagues from the place where they are, and the transit is obstructed by the enemy? terrified by the horrendous betrayal suffered, on the contrary sought to perform the most relevant and valuable services which are of public notoriety, and confirmed by the documents gathered; and many others I could present if it were not for the distance of more than 100 leagues in which they are, with transit impeded by the enemy. Beyond what has been stated, the Supplicant remains to inform you to ponder to His Imperial Majesty that not having had time to establish his household and seek means of subsistence for his family, he has, moreover, been burdened by great expenses, indispensable in the current crisis, to make and maintain good gatherings of people as he has done. Verified with letters from the Excellency former Presidents José de Araújo, Chagas, Antero, Bento Manuel, Marshal Barreto, Brigadier Carneiro and other leaders to whom the Supplicant can present the most flattering praises and thanks in the name of the homeland. The Supplicant is poor, has a wife and 5 children to support, and for this reason believes himself deserving of being granted a pension as he requests, demanding from your integrity that weighing in the balance of justice the services rendered by the Supplicant, you provide him, through your respectable deliberations, the grace of which he is made worthy, as an example of others who have rendered equal or perhaps lesser services, and have already been rewarded with pensions and for this he hopes for equal reward and… \n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho."
