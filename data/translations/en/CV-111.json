  "translation": "Petition (fragmentary)\n\n... that had to be won. When Your Excellencies were facing the most delicate crisis; when all the chiefs were forced either to emigrate to neighboring provinces or into fortified places; when, finally, the campaign was entirely of the rebels, and there was no hope of resources; it was in this very time that the Petitioner, helped by many meritorious citizens, made a formal opposition to the anarchists, with whom he maintained continuous guerrilla warfare and honorable polemics for legality during a period of 3 months, until the Most Excellent Mr. Barreto, tired of suffering, presented himself in the field and came to give soul—hope—to the legalists, marching, despite a thousand sacrifices, to oppose the front of 500 men that the Petitioner had in the various points of his responsibility; but before this experienced General had time to recognize the terrain, the enemy, and the force he commanded, and to provide for the scarcity of armaments and ammunition that existed, we were attacked by an anarchist force under the command of Bento Manuel Ribeiro of 700 men, on July 7 of the current year, a day on which we had already suffered many desertions and a horrible betrayal by Evaristo dos Santos Robalo, who commanded a squadron that did not come, it not being possible to place him in his position, in São Gabriel (being the only officer to whom this happened), where he remained until a legal force commanded by Ensign Juca Cipriano entered that place; the Petitioner asked him for help with horses and men, and with 6 men he brought in his company, and blacks and peasants he carried, he attacked in his march to Cima da Serra a group of anarchists that were in the Campestres, commanded by Lieutenant Corporal Juca, and defeating them he took two horses and saddles from the enemy, and had the satisfaction to present himself to the same Most Excellent Mr. Barreto on October 1, when that same lord was already promoting the gathering which, supported by the Petitioner and other citizens, reached the number of 400 men, at the head of whom he marched to this point, suffering some desertions on the way; he had the glory to accompany the same Most Excellent Mr. as commander of that brigade which is today encamped at Picada; all of which is evident to the illustrious Commission.\n\nThe Petitioner, Your Excellencies, could well have made or could make it evident to your views that, suffering from a chronic and terrible illness to avoid the service, he did not hesitate; but despising his life to attend to the demands of the homeland, at a time when he could not be noticed without injustice, at a time when all were ecstatic, if you do not recognize that such circumstances will undoubtedly not escape your perspicacity. You, gentlemen, are all witnesses of this report, since all these facts were acted out openly in the Province and undoubtedly would come to your knowledge those whom you did not witness. I could, gentlemen, present everything well documented; however, since I have (the documents), being nearly 100 leagues away from the place where they are, and with transit obstructed by the enemy? terrified by the horrible betrayal he suffered, on the contrary, he sought to perform the most relevant and valuable services which are of public notoriety, and proven by the enclosed documents; and many others could be presented if it were not for the distance of more than 100 leagues where they are, with transit obstructed by the enemy.\n\nAside from what has been exposed, the Petitioner remains to inform and ponder to His Imperial Majesty that not having had time to establish his position and seek means of subsistence for his family, he has moreover been overburdened with great expenses, indispensable in the current crisis, to form and maintain good gatherings of men as he has done. Verified with letters from the Most Excellent former Presidents José de Araújo, Chagas, Antero, Bento Manuel, Marshal Barreto, Brigadier Carneiro and other chiefs from whom the Petitioner can present the most flattering praises and thanks in the name of the homeland.\n\nThe Petitioner is poor, has a wife and 5 children to support and for this reason he deems himself deserving that he be granted a pension and thus requests it, demanding of your uprightness that weighing in the balance of justice the services rendered by the Petitioner, you provide him, through your respectable reports, the grace that he may be worthy of, following the example of others who have rendered equal or perhaps lesser services, and have already been rewarded with pensions and therefore expects equal reward and...\n\nRequest for Mercy\n\nNota Bene Porto Alegre, and we defeated them and, subsequently, Rio Pardo.\n\nAntônio de Melo e Albuquerque\n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho.
