  "translation": "Having soldier Domingos Vicente, from the squadron under my command, presented himself at the barracks with a shaved mustache, and considering this soldier's behavior not only an act of insubordination but also a kind of sedition by someone hidden, I arrested him and ordered him to be confined in the prisons of the 8th Battalion by order of Your Excellency."
