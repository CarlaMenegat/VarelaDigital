  "translation": "Most Illustrious Excellent Sir\n\nIn accordance with the orders and instructions of Your Excellency on the 1st of this month at 7 o'clock in the evening, I marched from the Picada camp with 120 men of the 5th Corps of National Guard Cavalry under my command and 24 men of the Faxinal Squadron under the command of Major Simas, commanded by Lieutenant Demétrio and Ensign Claro; and embarking, with the appropriate horses, on the three barges, towed by two war launches with their competent garrisons and crews, I disembarked at Morretes at 11 o'clock at night; and forming the necessary divisions, at one o'clock in the morning I marched on the enemy’s positions, cutting through, with some difficulty, fields and marshes, leaving the enemy’s advanced guards to the rear; and at 5 o'clock in the morning, I ambushed my forces in a thicket, which was a quarter of a league from the estate called Demanda, where the enemy was; and at 8 o'clock in the morning I marched on the enemy; and upon being attacked, they were completely scattered, with the Commander of the Force, Major Duarte Martins Canabarro, brother of David Canabarro, being captured, grievously wounded in an arm by a cut; and Lieutenant Francisco Xavier, nephew of Bento Manuel Ribeiro, and ten soldiers; five rebel soldiers and one sergeant were killed on the field, quite ill; we captured some armament, 18 saddled horses, and more than 80 horses, of which I selected fifty which I ordered to be placed on the islands, and sixty head of cattle that the barges could carry. No injury was sustained by the legality forces. On my retreat I found Morretes in good order, 230 infantry commanded by Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, who had brought the steam barge “Liberal,” whom I did not need to deploy.\n\nAll the forces under my command behaved with their usual energy and vigor, as did the crews and garrisons of the mentioned war vessels. I withdrew with everything from Morretes from 8 to 9 o'clock at night, and reached the Picada camp safely at 10 o'clock the same night.\n\nGod guard Your Excellency  \nPicada Camp, April 3, 1839  \nMost Illustrious Excellent Sir Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nInterim Major Commander of the 5th Corps"
