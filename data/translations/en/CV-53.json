  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn accordance with the orders and instructions of Your Excellency on the 1st of this month at 7 o’clock in the evening, I marched from the Picada camp with 120 men of the 5th National Guard Cavalry Corps under my command and 24 men of the Faxinal Squadron under the command of Major Simas, commanded by Lieutenant Demétrio and Ensign Claro; and, embarked with the appropriate horses, on three barges, towed by two war launches, with their competent garrison and crew, I disembarked at Morretes at 11 o’clock at night; and forming the necessary divisions, at one o’clock in the morning I marched on the enemy’s positions, cutting through, with some difficulty, fields and swamps, leaving the enemy’s advanced guards to the rear; and at 5 o’clock in the morning, I ambushed my forces in a thicket, which was a quarter league from the estate called Demanda, where the enemy was found, and at 8 o’clock in the day I marched on the enemy; and upon being attacked, they were completely dispersed, with the capture of the Commander of the Force, Major Duarte Martins Canabarro, brother of David Canabarro, who was seriously wounded in an arm by a cut, and Lieutenant Francisco Xavier, nephew of Bento Manuel Ribeiro, and ten soldiers; five rebel soldiers and one sergeant were left dead on the field, quite badly; some armament remained in our power, 18 saddled horses and more than 80 horses, from which I selected fifty that I ordered to be placed on the islands, and sixty cattle that the barges could carry. There were no injuries on the side of legality. On my withdrawal, I met at Morretes in good order 230 infantrymen commanded by Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, who had conducted the steamboat “Liberal,” who did not need to operate.\n\nAll the forces under my command conducted themselves with the usual energy and vigor, as well as the crews and garrisons of the aforementioned war vessels. I carried out my withdrawal with everything from Morretes from 8 to 9 o’clock at night, and arrived safely at the Picada camp at 10 o’clock the same night.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.  \nPicada Camp, April 3, 1839.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.  \nInterim Major Commander of the 5th Corps."
