  "translation": "According to the orders and instructions of Your Excellency, on the 1st of this month at 7 o'clock in the evening, I marched from the Picada camp with 120 men from the 5th Cavalry Corps of National Guard under my command and 24 men from the Faxinal Squadron under Major Simas' command, led by Lieutenant Demétrio and Ensign Claro; and proceeding embarked, with the necessary horses, on three boats, towed by two war barges, with their proper garrison and crew, I disembarked in Morretes at 11 o’clock at night; and forming the necessary divisions, at one o'clock in the morning, I marched against the enemy positions, cutting through some difficulties of fields and marshes, leaving the enemy’s advanced guards to the rear; and at 5 o'clock in the morning, I ambushed my forces in a thicket, which was a quarter league away from the estate called Demanda, where the enemy was situated, and at 8 o'clock in the morning, I marched upon the enemy; and being attacked, they were completely dispersed, with the Commander of the Force, Major Duarte Martins Canabarro, brother of David Canabarro, being captured, severely wounded in an arm by a saber stroke, along with Lieutenant Francisco Xavier, nephew of Bento Manuel Ribeiro, and ten soldiers; five rebel soldiers and one sergeant were left dead in the field; we seized some armament, 18 saddled horses, and more than 80 horses, of which I chose fifty to be placed in the islands, and sixty cattle that the boats were able to transport. There were no injuries related to legality. In my retreat, I found Morretes in good order, 230 infantry under the command of Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, who had brought the steam boat “Liberal,” which did not require any operations.\n\nAll the forces under my command behaved with the customary energy and vigor, as did the crews and garrisons of the aforementioned war vessels. I executed my retreat from Morretes between 8 and 9 o’clock at night, and happily arrived at the Picada camp at 10 o’clock the same night."
