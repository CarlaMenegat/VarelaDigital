  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn accordance with the orders and instructions of Your Excellency of the 1st of the current month at 7 o'clock in the evening, I marched from the camp at Picada with 120 men of the 5th Corps of the National Guard Cavalry under my command, and 24 men of the Faxinal Squadron under the command of Major Simas, commanded by Lieutenant Demétrio and Ensign Claro; and embarking, with the corresponding horses, on three barges, towed by two war launches, with their competent garrison and crew, I disembarked at Morretes at 11 o'clock at night; and forming the necessary divisions, at one o'clock in the morning I marched on the enemy’s positions, cutting, with some difficulty, through fields and marshes, leaving the enemy’s advanced guards to the rear; and at 5 o'clock in the morning, I ambushed my forces in a thicket, which was a quarter of a league distant from the estate called Demanda, where the enemy was located, and at 8 o'clock in the day I marched on the enemy; and being attacked, they were completely dispersed, with the Commander of the Force, Major Duarte Martins Canabarro, brother of David Canabarro, being taken prisoner, having been severely wounded in one arm by a cut, and Lieutenant Francisco Xavier, nephew of Bento Manuel Ribeiro, and ten soldiers; five rebel soldiers and one sergeant were killed on the field, quite badly; some armaments fell into our possession, 18 bridled horses and more than 80 horses, of which I chose fifty that I ordered to be placed on the islands, and sixty cattle which the barges could carry. There were no injuries to legality. On my retreat I found Morretes in good order, with 230 infantry commanded by Major Francisco Félix da Fonseca, who had brought the steamboat \"Liberal,\" which it was not necessary to operate.\n\nAll the forces under my command acted with the usual energy and vigor, as did the crews and garrisons of the aforementioned war vessels. I made my retreat with everything from Morretes from 8 to 9 o'clock at night, and happily arrived at the camp at Picada at 10 o'clock of the same night.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency. Camp at Picada, April 3, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nInterim Major Commander of the 5th Corps."
