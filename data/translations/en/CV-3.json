  "translation": "Friend and Sir Almeida, São Lourenço, November 13, 1841\n\nYou will see, Your Mercy, that Saint John the Baptist was not expanded, for fear of offending some who strive to take away the right of this poor José de Sousa, and give it to the European João José da Costa. In short, my friend, I am certain, Your Mercy\n\nAlways the same Your grateful and old friend Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu\n\nAnswered on November 30, 1841. Letter from Domingos José de Almeida."
