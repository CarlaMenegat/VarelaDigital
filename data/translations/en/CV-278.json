  "translation": "My distinguished colonel and respectable friend  \nPiratini, January 9, 1839.\n\nNot wishing to take a decision regarding the primary school teacher of São Gabriel without consulting Your Excellency, Your Excellency\n\nYour secretary must necessarily be lacking, but the position for which he was entrusted is vacant because it is not right to fill it while the owner is employed there. I believe he will not lack patriotism and that, if he wishes to keep his job, he must himself put another in his place, or resign it to later be employed in something better.\n\nTell me, Your Excellency,\n\nYour sincere and very grateful friend  \nDomingos José de Almeida  \nPiratini, January 9, 1839"
