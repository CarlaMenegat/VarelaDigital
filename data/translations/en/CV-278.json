  "translation": "My distinguished colonel and respectable friend  \nPiratini, January 9, 1839.\n\nNot wishing to take any decision regarding the primary school teacher of São Gabriel without consulting Your Excellency, Your Excellency\n\nYour secretary must necessarily be a loss to you, but the ministry for which he was appointed remains vacant because it is not in accordance with justice to provide for him while the owner is employed there. I trust that he will not lack patriotism and that, if he wishes to keep his position, he must himself put another in his place, or resign it in order to be later employed in a better position.\n\nTell me, Your Excellency,\n\nYour sincere and very grateful friend  \nDomingos José de Almeida  \nPiratini, January 9, 1839"
