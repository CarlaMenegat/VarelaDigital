  "translation": "Not wanting to make a decision about the elementary school teacher in São Gabriel without consulting Your Excellency, \n\nYour Excellency,\n\nYour secretary must necessarily be missed, but the ministry for which he was appointed is vacant because it does not conform to justice to fill it while the owner is still employed there. I believe that he will not lack patriotism, and that in wanting to secure his position, he himself should find someone else to take his place, or resign it to then be employed in something better.\n\nLet me know, Your Excellency."
