  "translation": "Yesterday I wrote to you through Vicente, and I have nothing more to add except that at midnight I set out for this place embarked on a large skiff, in which, having a good course, I arrived here in the early morning today, and shortly after nine o'clock I gathered at the house designated for the sessions of the Assembly, which began today. The city seems good to me, but I suppose I will not stay here long, and I already regret having sent the horses back without first probing into these matters, etc., etc. I am in a famous and large house inhabited only by me and Xavier Ferreira. Please give my regards to all our friends, to whom I have not yet written due to lack of time, but I will do so by yacht."
