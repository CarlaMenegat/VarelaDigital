  "translation": "My dear old woman of my heart. Porto Alegre, April 19, 1835.\n\nYesterday I wrote to you by Vicente, and I have nothing more to add except that at midnight I set out for this place on a large skiff, on which, with good sailing, I arrived here at dawn today, and at nine o'clock I gathered at the house intended for the sessions of the Assembly, which commenced today. The city seems good to me, but I suppose I will not stay here long, and I already regret having sent the horses back without first investigating these matters, etc., etc. I am in a splendid and large house inhabited only by Xavier Ferreira and myself. I recommend myself to all our people, to whom I have not yet written for lack of time, but I will do so by the yacht.\n\nAffectionate greetings to our dear children, and receive the heart of your old man who loves you very much, Almeida"
