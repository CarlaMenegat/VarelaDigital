  "translation": "My old dear. Porto Alegre, April 19, 1835.\n\nYesterday I wrote to you through Vicente, and I have nothing more to add except that at midnight I set out for here on a large skiff, on which, with good sailing, I arrived here at dawn today, and by nine o'clock I joined the house designated for the Assembly sessions, which began today. The city seems good to me, but I suppose I will stay here little, and I already regret having sent the horses back without first probing these matters, etc., etc. I am in a famous and large house inhabited only by Xavier Ferreira and myself. I recommend myself to all ours, to whom I have not yet written for lack of time, but I will do so through the yacht.\n\nHugs to our dear children and receive the heart of your old man who loves you very much Almeida"
