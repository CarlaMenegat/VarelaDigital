  "translation": "Bagé, January 28, 1842. Most Excellent Sir General João Antônio\n\nThe purpose of this is to warn Your Excellency José Mariano de Matos, so that Your Excellency José Mariano, if he so wishes, may do so, and it would be good that he not compel me to the most terrible contingency. Under the circumstances in which I find myself, only the consideration and friendship of my compatriots can soften the bitterness of my situation.\n\nBelieve, Your Excellency,  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nTo citizen General João Antônio da Silveira. Wherever he may be found. From his friend and compatriot Serafim Joaquim de Alencastre.\n\nAnswered on March 7, 1842."
