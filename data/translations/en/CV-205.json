  "translation": "As far as I still remember, it was the plan of your trip, when you left here, to go to the house of Senhor José Rodrigues Chaves, and from there to set off immediately to one of Manuel Gonçalves's or Ramirez's farms, since Senhor Raimundo Senandes offered to assist you with anything you might need. In any of these places it seems good to me, because as soon as I can leave for there, I will go, and then to Uruguay, where I intend to establish my residence. Today they told me that you were going to Uncle Luís, and I believed it due to the direction of your journey. This is by no means convenient for us; therefore, it is still time for you to go where I desire. You have your brother Bernardino, now more so in Paraguay, and even compadre João, as soon as he knows that for disposing of the hides, there is no place like Cerro Largo, and besides that, I am quite certain they will escort you along the way, if necessary."
