  "translation": "Bernardina\n\nIf I still remember correctly, your plan when you left here was to go to the house of Senhor José Rodrigues Chaves, and from there to immediately depart for one of the estates of Manuel Gonçalves or Ramirez, since Senhor Raimundo Senandes offered himself to assist you with whatever you might need. Either of these locations seems good to me, because as soon as I can go there, I will, and afterward to Uruguay, where I intend to establish my residence. Today they told me that you were going to uncle Luís, and I believed it because of the direction of your journey. This does not suit us in any way; therefore, there is still time for you to follow where I desire. You have your brother Bernardino, now also in Paraguay, and even compadre João, as soon as he learns that there is a place like Cerro Largo to dispose of the hides, and besides, I am quite sure that along the way they will escort you, if necessary.\n\nGreetings to our children and regards to the comadres, compadres, and siblings. Your husband who loves you very much Pelotas, October 20, 1836. Almeida"
