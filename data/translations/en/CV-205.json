  "translation": "Bernardina\n\nIf I still remember correctly, it was the plan of your journey, when you left here, to go to the house of Senhor José Rodrigues Chaves, and from there depart immediately to one of the farms of Manuel Gonçalves or Ramirez, since Senhor Raimundo Senandes offered himself for anything you might need. Either of these places seems fine to me, because as soon as I can leave I will go there, and then to Uruguai, where I intend to establish my residence. Today they told me you were going to Uncle Luís, and I believed it from the direction of your travel. This does not suit us in any way; therefore it is still time for you to follow where I wish. You have your brother Bernardino, now also in Paraguay, and even your godfather João, as soon as he knows that there is no place to deal with the hides like Cerro Largo, and besides, I am certain you will be escorted along the way if necessary.\n\nHugs to our children and regards to the godmothers, godfathers, and siblings. Your husband who loves you very much Pelotas, October 20, 1836. Almeida"
