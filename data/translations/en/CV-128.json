  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nYour Excellency, on the 14th of this month, at 7 o'clock in the evening, a slight report came here that the wicked legalists from Cima da Serra would enter. The police gathered at the same hour consisting of 12 men; I sent them outside the town, remaining myself; and when it was dawn on the 15th, as I opened the door I found myself face to face with the enemy, and I had no choice but to stop, and at that moment Lieutenant José Jacinto appeared on the field, who was coming toward the town on reconnaissance, and upon discovering the enemy withdrew with 6 men toward the police, and the enemy charged at him, and this lieutenant, who found it difficult to turn his back to the enemy, charged at him, resulting in him being seriously wounded, as well as an enemy officer; and by around 9 o'clock in the morning they immediately retreated to Cima da Serra, causing no further harm, perhaps believing that there was a force nearby, with the commander of the force (which was to consist of 100 men), Alferes Padilha, Lieutenant João Batista de Oliveira, Lieutenant Bueno, and the police commander of São Martinho, all from Cima da Serra, whom Padilha had hidden, with this gathering organized by the aforementioned police commander and that Oliveira.\n\nAnd today a soldier of citizen Colonel Agostinho appeared here with an open letter from his wife for the said colonel, who is said to be in Rio Pardo, which the soldier brought along with an order that I submit to Your Excellency. Cruz Alta, informing me of the indicated fellow regarding the outcome at Cruz Alta, who was carrying orders for Colonel Agostinho Botucaraí, and that the referred order instructed him to cancel the orders he was carrying. Upon seeing Melo Brabo attack the police of Cruz Alta, they lost that police and those who strayed passed by the Cadeado estate, and they rounded up all the horses, heading toward São Xavier. The same soldier says that Melo, father of Lieutenant Colonel Antônio de Melo e Albuquerque, had delivered the money from the Collection and made payment to the men gathered at Cruz Alta, numbering around 200, while the force that came from Vacaria commanded by a Candinho remained toward the Passo Fundo. And I, Most Excellent Sir,"
