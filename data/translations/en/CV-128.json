  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir, Your Excellency, on the 14th of the current month, at about 7 o’clock in the evening, a slight report arrived here that the wicked legalists from Cima da Serra were entering here; the police assembled at the same hour, numbering 12 men; I sent them outside the town, remaining myself; and at dawn on the 15th, with the troop, opening the door, I encountered the enemy, and I had no choice but to stop; at that moment Lieutenant José Jacinto appeared in the field, who was scouting around the town, and discovering the enemy, he withdrew with 6 men towards the police side, and the enemy charged against him; this lieutenant, having difficulty turning his face to the enemy, charged back against it, resulting in him being seriously wounded, as well as an enemy officer; and around 9 o’clock of the day they immediately retreated to Cima da Serra, causing no further harm, perhaps supposing there was a force nearby, commanded by (whose was a force of 100 men) Ensign Padilha, Lieutenant João Batista de Oliveira, Lieutenant Bueno, and the commander of the Police of São Martinho, all from Cima da Serra, whom Padilha had hidden, with the meeting arranged by said police commander and the said Oliveira.  \n\nAnd today a soldier of citizen Colonel Agostinho appeared here with an open letter from his wife to the said colonel who is said to be at Rio Pardo, the soldier carrying a decree, which I send along to Your Excellency Cruz Alta, the comrade indicated telling me the news from Cruz Alta that, while carrying letters to Colonel Agostinho Botucaraí, the said one in the decree had ordered him to forward and cancel the letters he was carrying, and that seeing Melo Brabo attack the Police of Cruz Alta, they lost said police and the fugitives passed through the Cadeado station, and they took all the cattle, next going to São Xavier. The same soldier says that Melo, father of Lieutenant-Colonel Antônio de Melo e Albuquerque, had delivered the Collectory’s money and made payment to the men who gathered at Cruz Alta, numbering about 200, leaving the force that came from Vacaria commanded by a Candinho to the areas of Passo Fundo; and I, Most Excellent Sir,  \n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nChapel of Santa Maria, 16 December 1839  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent José Gomes Porto, Justice of the Peace.\n\nCertified as true.
