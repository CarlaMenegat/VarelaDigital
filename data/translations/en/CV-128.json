  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Exalted Sir\n\nMost Illustrious and Exalted Sir, Your Excellency, on the 14th of the current month, at around 7 o’clock in the evening, a slight report arrived here about the arrival of the wicked legalists from Cima da Serra; the police assembled at the same hour, numbering 12 men; I sent forces outside the town, remaining myself; and when day broke on the 15th, along with the troop, as I opened the door I encountered the enemy, and I had no choice but to stand my ground, and at that moment Lieutenant José Jacinto appeared on the field, who was scouting around the town; upon discovering the enemy he retreated with six men towards the police side; the enemy charged upon him, and that lieutenant, to whom it was difficult to turn his back on the enemy, charged back; this resulted in him being seriously wounded, as well as an enemy officer; and when it was about 9 o’clock, they immediately withdrew to Cima da Serra, causing no further harm, perhaps supposing there was strength nearby, the commander of the force (which was about 100 men) being Ensign Padilha, Lieutenant João Batista de Oliveira, Lieutenant Bueno, and the police commander of São Martinho, all from Cima da Serra, whom Padilha had hidden, their meeting having been arranged by the said police commander and the said Oliveira. And today a soldier of citizen Colonel Agostinho appeared to me here with an open letter from his wife to said colonel, who is said to be at Rio Pardo, the soldier carrying an order, which I forward to Your Excellency; Cruz Alta, the comrade informed me of the results at Cruz Alta, that while carrying dispatches to Colonel Agostinho Botucaraí, the one referred to in the order commanded to confiscate the dispatches he was carrying; and that seeing Melo Brabo attack the police of Cruz Alta, the said police were routed and the fugitives passed through the estate of Cadeado, and later went on to São Xavier. The same soldier says that Melo, father of Lieutenant-colonel Antônio de Melo e Albuquerque, had delivered the money from the Collection House and made payment to the men gathered in Cruz Alta, amounting to about 200, and that the force that came from Vacaria, commanded by a Candinho, remained towards the Passo Fundo district; and I, Most Exalted Sir,\n\nGod protect Your Excellency Capela de Santa Maria, December 16, 1839 Most Illustrious and Exalted José Gomes Porto, justice of the peace.\n\nIt is as stated.
