  "translation": "I received yours by the cadet and another one from 15, which I greatly appreciated knowing that you were well and our son; I am aware, from the letter you wrote to me via Santa Isabel, that although the Assembly closes, you will go to the army, for you should go as soon as possible, before you get stuck in that cursed place.\n\nThey say that Moringue is not in the army, that he will march, I don't know where; perhaps it is there, because it seems that there are strong meetings; on the other hand, it is to be supposed that they will go to that place, for I wish to see you out of there for all reasons; with Paulino's death, there may be more others, and you need to be very cautious.\n\nKeep in mind that now Bento Manuel is out. I have here some letters from João da Cunha; I do not send them because the bearer is not safe. I received the order from João Alexandre; from Genuíno, I received 4 ounces the first time and 20 silver patacões the second; he said that when he had it, he would give the rest; from Luís Machado, from the first order, I received 179$520 rs.; I have not received anything from the second and have no hope of receiving it; if it were for Macedo or Candall, he would have had money.\n\nI again recommend that you be very careful; it is better for you to come with the Reverend Father."
