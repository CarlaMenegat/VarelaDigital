  "translation": "Bagé, February 25, 1843. My dear husband.\n\nI received yours by the cadet and another from the 15th which I valued very much because I knew that you were well and our son too; I am informed, in the letter you wrote to me by Santa Isabel, that even if the Assembly is closed, you will go to the army, for you must go as soon as possible, before you are cut off there in that cursed place.\n\nThey say Moringue is not in the army, that he will march, I don't know where; perhaps it is there, because it is said that there are strong gatherings; on the other hand, it is to be supposed they go there in that place, for I would wish to see you out of there for all reasons; with the death of Paulino more may happen, and you must be very cautious.\n\nLook, now Bento Manuel is away. I have here some letters from João da Cunha; I do not send them to you because the bearer is not safe. I received the order from João Alexandre; from Genuíno I received the first time 4 ounces and the second 20 silver patacões; he said, when he had it, that he would give the rest; from Luís Machado, from the first order, I received 179$520 rs.; I have not yet received anything from the second nor any hope of receiving it; if it were for Macedo or Candall he would have money.\n\nAll the children remain well and ask for your blessing. From your wife who esteems you very much, Bernardina.\n\nI once again recommend that you be very careful; it is better that you come with the Reverend Father.\n\nTo Mr. Domingos José de Almeida — Alegrete.\n\nAnswered on March 5, 1843."
