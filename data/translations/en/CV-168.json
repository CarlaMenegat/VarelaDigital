  "translation": "Bagé, February 25, 1843. My dear husband.\n\nI received yours by the cadet and another from the 15th which I valued greatly for knowing that you were well and our son; I become aware, in the letter you wrote me by Santa Isabel, that even if the Assembly is closed, you will go to the army, for you must go as soon as possible, before you are cut off there in that cursed place.\n\nThey say Moringue is not in the army, that he will march, I don't know where; maybe it is there, because it is known that there are strong gatherings; on the other hand, it is to be supposed that they are going to that place because I would wish to see you out of there for all reasons; with Paulino’s death there may be others, and you must be very cautious.\n\nLook, now Bento Manuel is away. I have here some letters from João da Cunha; I do not send them to you because the bearer is not reliable. I received the order from João Alexandre; from Genuíno I received at first 4 ounces and the second time 20 silver patacões; he said, when he had more, he would give the rest; from Luís Machado, the first order, I received 179$520 rs.; I have not yet received anything from the second nor any hope of receiving; if it were for Macedo or Candall he would have money.\n\nThe children are all well and ask for your blessing. From your wife who esteems you greatly, Bernardina.\n\nI again urge you to be very careful; it is better that you come with the Reverend Father.\n\nTo Senhor Domingos José de Almeida — Alegrete.\n\nAnswered March 5, 1843."
