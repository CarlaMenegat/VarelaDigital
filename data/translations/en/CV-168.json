  "translation": "Bagé, February 25, 1843. My dear husband.\n\nI received yours by the cadet and another from the 15th, which I valued greatly for knowing that you were well and our son; I am informed, in the letter you wrote to me by the Santa Isabel, that even if the Assembly closes, you will go to the army, for you must go as soon as possible, before you are cut off there in that cursed place.\n\nThey say Moringue is not in the army, that he will march I do not know where; maybe it is there, because it is said that there are strong meetings; on the other hand, it is to be supposed that they are going there to that place, for I would like to see you out of there for all reasons; with the death of Paulino there may be others, and you need to be very cautious.\n\nLook, now Bento Manuel is away. I have here some letters from João da Cunha; I do not send them to you because the bearer is not safe. I received the order from João Alexandre; from Genuíno I received the first time 4 ounces and the second 20 silver patacões; he said, when he had more, that he would give the rest; from Luís Machado, from the first order, I received 179$520 rs.; I have not yet received anything from the second nor hope to receive; if it were for Macedo or Candall he would have money.\n\nAll the children are well and ask for your blessing. From your wife who values you greatly, Bernardina.\n\nI again recommend that you be very careful; it is better that you come with the Reverend Father.\n\nTo Senhor Domingos José de Almeida — Alegrete.\n\nAnswered March 5, 1843."
