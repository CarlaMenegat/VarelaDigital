  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nAcknowledging the government which, for the prompt consolidation of the republican system, which the great majority of the inhabitants of this State have solemnly proclaimed and sworn to defend, it is absolutely necessary to contract a loan, which, ensuring advantageous profit to the bidders, meets the needs of the war without burdening the already overloaded peoples, and even to avoid violent measures, although applicable in the current state of affairs, has charged me to promote the said loan, as can be seen from the decree dated May 29 of this year.\n\nFor this reason, I address Your Excellency 5,000$000 rs. in silver or gold, which shall be paid to you within the term set by the said decree with a premium of one and a half percent per month, which shall begin to accrue from the day the document in due form is delivered to you at this Secretariat.\n\nFor the Treasury on this date, indeed in this city, Your Excellency will send Your Excellency\n\nPiratini, June 9, 1837.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida.\n\nReceived on June 19 and replied the same day and year 1837. Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic Most Illustrious Sir Tito Teixeira Pinto. From the Ministry of Finance."
