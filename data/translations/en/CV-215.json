  "translation": "Recognizing the government that for the prompt consolidation of the republican system, which the vast majority of the inhabitants of this State have solemnly proclaimed and which he has sworn to defend, it is of absolute necessity to contract a loan, ensuring a beneficial profit to the competitors, that will meet the requirements of the war without burdening the already overloaded people, and even to disregard violent measures, though applicable in the current state of affairs, I have been entrusted with promoting the aforementioned loan, as can be seen from the attached decree of May 29 of the past year.\n\nFor this reason, I address Your Excellency 5,000$000 rs. in silver or gold, which will be paid to you within the timeframe outlined in the aforementioned decree with a premium of one and a half percent per month, which will begin to run from the day the document is delivered in proper form in this Secretariat.\n\nFor the Treasury on this date, moreover in this city, Your Excellency will send Your Excellency Piratini, June 9, 1837."
