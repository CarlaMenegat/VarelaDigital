  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nRecognizing the government that for the prompt consolidation of the republican system, which the great majority of the inhabitants of this State have solemnly proclaimed and sworn to defend, it is an absolute necessity to contract a loan, which, ensuring advantageous profit to the bidders, will meet the needs of the war without burdening the already overburdened people, and even to avoid violent measures, although applicable in the current circumstances, I have been entrusted to promote the said loan, as is seen from the decree attached dated May 29 of this year.\n\nFor the same reason, I address Your Excellency for 5,000,000 rs. in silver or gold, which will be paid to you within the term set by the aforementioned decree with a premium of one and a half percent per month, which shall begin to run from the day the document in proper form is delivered to you at this Secretariat.\n\nFor the Treasury on this date, in fact in this city, Your Excellency will send Your Excellency\n\nPiratini, June 9, 1837.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida.\n\nReceived on June 19 and replied on the same day and year 1837.\n\nSecretariat of the Presidency of the Republic\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Tito Teixeira Pinto\n\nFrom the Ministry of Finance."
