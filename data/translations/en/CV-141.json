  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nThe official letter of Your Lordship 17 was presented to the government, including the copy of Captain Fileno’s report; and, having reviewed its contents, there is nothing to add in response except to reiterate the orders issued on the 17th and 18th of the current month. No communication has been received regarding the force that appeared in Taquari, which might suggest either that it remains stationed there or has retreated, which will not be possible given the advance of the one that proceeded to Bagé.\n\nGod guard Your Lordship  \nSecretary of War Affairs in Caçapava, March 19, 1840  \nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
