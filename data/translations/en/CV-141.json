  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nThe office of Your Lordship 17, including the copy of Captain Fileno's report, has been presented to the government; and, being informed of its contents, there is nothing to add in response, except to reiterate the orders issued on the 17th and 18th of the current month. No communication has been received from the force that appeared at Taquari, whereby it may be suspected that it is either stationed there or has retreated, which will not be possible considering the march of the one that headed toward Bagé.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nWar Department in Caçapava, March 19, 1840.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
