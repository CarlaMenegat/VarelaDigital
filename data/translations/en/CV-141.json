  "translation": "The letter from Your Excellency was submitted to the government, including a copy of Captain Fileno's report; and, having taken note of its contents, there is nothing to add in response, other than to reiterate the orders issued on the 17th and 18th of this month. No communication has come from the force that appeared in Taquari, which leads to the suspicion that it is either stationed there or has retreated, which would not be possible given the movement of the one that is heading to Bagé."
