  "translation": "I, the undersigned, Urbano José Afonso, declare that I have justly and duly contracted with Mr. Julião Castro the sale of my ranch establishment, located on the coast of Canhitas, with a league and a half of land more or less, in the department of Salto, in the Eastern State, with all the bovine, equine, mule, and any other animals that are considered to be my property, existing on the land that I possess, under the conditions mentioned below:\n\nFor this reason, we have drawn up two documents of this same nature and entirely alike, to which we grant as much strength and vigor as if it were a public deed, and for certainty of the truth we sign with the witnesses declared below.\n\nMade in Arapey Chico, on September 18, 1848."
