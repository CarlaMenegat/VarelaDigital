  "translation": "Private contract of purchase and sale of establishment and brands\n\nI, the undersigned, Urbano José Afonso, declare that I have justly contracted with Senhor Julião Castro the sale of my ranch establishment, located on the coast of Canhitas, with about one and a half leagues of land, in the department of Salto, in the Oriental State, with all the cattle, horses, mules, and any others that are considered to be my property, existing on the land of which I am possessed, under the conditions below mentioned:\n\n- From this day onward, Senhor Julião Castro shall be the buyer, owner, and possessor of the brands belonging to my establishment and of my property here and in any place where any animal bearing said brands may be found, under the security of the sale I have made to him of them.\n- I, as seller and resident in Brazil, shall have the right and faculty to recruit the animals bearing said brands existing in the province of Rio Grande do Sul, for a period of six months, and to rebrand them; and if I do not comply, at the end of said term, I shall lose the right.\n- The brands which I sell are the following, namely: mine and that of my son Antônio José Afonso, for which I shall be responsible regarding my son's brand in case any doubt arises.\n- The sale of the brands and all animals belonging to them was agreed upon for eight hundred silver pesos, Senhor Julião Castro, as buyer, obliging himself to make the first payment on sight of four hundred and twenty-three pesos, which I have already received at the signing hereof, and three hundred and seventy-seven pesos, at a term of five months, by a note signed by him at said term.\n- Should the buyer Julião Castro have occasion to reap any benefit from cattle by selling them to the charqueada (meat curing plant) or to any other place understood for the same purpose, he shall be obliged—except for the term I give him—to perform the said payment, even if the said term is not yet due.\n- The buyer Julião Castro is obliged to strictly comply with the below-mentioned provisions, namely: to deliver to me or to my order six mules of brand upward, as well as twelve mares in the same conformity, whenever I or my order require them; also six colts, including one bay brindle shepherd; and likewise, by my order, of which I reserve, the following: to D. Nazário Verão four male cattle; to D. Valdomiro Sousa, two of the same; to Manuel Moreira de Miranda, one colt; to D. Filipe Rodrigues, one likewise; as well as to D. Maria Moreira da Silva one bay sheep-colored colt, from the herd of the well-known Bays.\n- From this day onward, I lose as seller the right of possession of the goods which by this contract I sell to Senhor Julião Castro, he remaining obliged to answer with his person and present and future goods for the prompt payment and execution thereof, just as I am to make the sale firm and valuable to him, both in and out of court, notwithstanding any third party.\n\nHaving so justly contracted and agreed, we execute two documents of the same tenor and entirely equal, to which we give as much force and strength as if it were a public deed, and for certainty of truth we sign with the witnesses below declared.\n\nDone in Arapey Chico, on September 18, 1848.\n\nUrbano José Afonso     Julião Castro  \nAs witnesses: Manuel Ferreira Bica     Justino Bernardes de Castro  \nAs witness who made and signed this: Manuel Moreira de Miranda"
