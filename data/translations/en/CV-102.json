  "translation": "I received yours of the 9th, which I contest, as I hold your feelings towards me in equal regard, and you may understand how sensitive your departure is to me in such a cruel crisis as this in which you leave us; however, you have great reason and God is much greater... etc.\n\nI am sending you a copy of the request I made to the Commission in Porto Alegre, a Commission that seems not to have proceeded due to the disorder in Rio Pardo; and I send you this so that you can extract what is necessary for the request in the Court, reminding you that Captain José Inácio, known as Juca Ourives, does not have half of my services and has 400$000 rs. of pension from Cunha, Silva Tavares, and others, etc... You well know what my services and works have been, and the enormous expenses I have incurred with the large gatherings I have organized which have amounted to more than 18,700 [sic] men since the beginning of the struggle, and my name has little appeared because I do not have the skill to make my services known. I am also sending you 2 letters from Araújo Ribeiro, 2 from Bento Manuel, 1 from Antero, 2 from Chagas, 1 from Brigadeiro Carneiro, two orders of the day that say something in my favor; and above all, a letter from Barreto, which I believe cannot be more favorable to any man; and I do not send more as I find these sufficient and I need the other documents. One of the orders of the day is to show that I commanded a brigade when I was presented as a prisoner, which was also assembled by me. And the other to show the distinction with which President Elzeário treats me there, etc. In short, you better know what you should do in light of the weak points I make to you, and what you already know; I kindly ask you to deal with this arrangement with the greatest urgency and energy that you deserve.\n\nNote Well: Luís Palmeiro writes to me in the letter that I am sending you along with the one from Minister Almeida, requesting the representation I gave to the Chamber, which is in your possession; therefore, send it to me along with the letters from Almeida and Palmeiro which are for seeing.\n\nGiven by the late Martim Francisco Filho."
