  "translation": "Amigo Oliveira\n\nCruz Alta, October 11, 1838.\n\nI received yours of the 9th to which I reply, very certain of your feelings towards me, which I reciprocate equally, you may assure yourself how sensitive I am to your withdrawal in such a cruel crisis as this in which you leave us; however, your reason is great and God is much greater... etc..\n\nI send you a copy of the petition I made to the Commission in Porto Alegre, a Commission which it seems to me did not proceed due to the disorders in Rio Pardo; and I send it to you to extract from it whatever is necessary for the petition to the Court, you should be warned that Captain José Inácio, by antonomasia Juca Ourives, does not have half of my services and has 400$000 rs. pension from Cunha, Silva Tavares and others etc.... You well know what my services and works have been, and what enormous expenses I have incurred with the strong assemblies I have held, which have amounted from the beginning of the struggle to more than 18,700 [sic] men, and my name has appeared little, because I do not have the skill to make my services prevail. I also send you 2 official letters from Araújo Ribeiro, 2 from Bento Manuel, 1 from Antero, 2 from Chagas, 1 from Brigadier Carneiro, two day orders that say something in my favor; and especially a letter from Barreto, which seems to me nothing better can be said of any man; and I do not send the others as these seem sufficient to me and I need the other documents. One of the day orders is to show that I commanded a brigade when I presented myself as prisoner, whose was also assembled by me. And the other to show the distinction with which President Elzeário treats me there, etc.. Finally, you better know what you must do in view of the few notes I make to you, and what you yourself know; however, I earnestly ask you to handle this arrangement with the greatest promptness and energy that it deserves.\n\nYour prosperity is greatly desired by he who is and will always be your sincere and obliged Brother Teseu\n\nNota Bene Luís Palmeiro writes me the letter which I enclose and send you together with that of Minister Almeida, requesting the representation I gave to the Chamber, which is in your possession; therefore send it to me as well as the letters of Almeida and Palmeiro which are for you to see.\n\nGiven by the late Martim Francisco Filho. A. Varela"
