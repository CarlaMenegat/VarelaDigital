  "translation": "Amigo Oliveira\n\nCruz Alta, October 11, 1838.\n\nI received yours of the 9th, to which I respond that I am very certain of your feelings towards me, which I return equally, and you may be assured how deeply I feel your withdrawal in such a cruel crisis as this in which you leave us; however, your reason is great and God even greater... etc..\n\nI send you a copy of the petition I made to the Commission in Porto Alegre, a Commission which it seems to me did not proceed due to the disorders in Rio Pardo; and I send it to you so that you may extract from it whatever is necessary for the petition to the Court, having to warn you that Captain José Inácio, by metonymy Juca Ourives, does not have half of my services and has 400,000 réis of pension from Cunha, Silva Tavares and others, etc.... You well know what my services and labors have been, and the enormous expenses I have incurred with the strong gatherings I have made, which have amounted since the beginning of the struggle to more than 18,700 [sic] men, and my name has little appeared, because I have no skill to assert my services. I also send you 2 letters from Araújo Ribeiro, 2 from Bento Manuel, 1 from Antero, 2 from Chagas, 1 from Brigadier Carneiro, two orders of the day which say something in my favor; and above all a letter from Barreto, which I think no better can be said of any man; and I do not send the others as these seem sufficient and the other documents are needed. One of the orders of the day is to show that I commanded a brigade when I presented myself as a prisoner, which was also gathered by me. And the other to show the distinction with which President Elzeário treats me there, etc.. Finally, you know best what you should do in view of the weak notes I make to you, and of what you yourself know; however, I earnestly ask you to handle this arrangement with the greatest promptness and energy that you deserve.\n\nYour prosperity is much desired by he who is and will always be your sincere and obliged Brother Teseu\n\nNota Bene Luís Palmeiro wrote me the letter which I enclose with this to you and the one from Minister Almeida, requesting the representation that I gave to the Chamber, which is in your possession; therefore send it to me as well as the letters from Almeida and Palmeiro which are for you to see.\n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho. A. Varela"
