  "translation": "Friend Oliveira\n\nCruz Alta, October 11, 1838.\n\nI received your letter of the 9th to which I respond, very certain of your feelings towards me, I reciprocate them equally, and you may understand how deeply I feel your withdrawal in such a cruel crisis as this in which you leave us; however, your reasoning is great and God is much greater... etc.\n\nI send you a copy of the request I made to the Commission in Porto Alegre, a Commission that seems to have had no progress due to the disorders in Rio Pardo; and I send it to you so that you may extract from it what is necessary for the request at the Court, warning you that Captain José Inácio, by antonomasia Juca Ourives, does not have half of my services and has 400$000 rs. pension Cunha, Silva Tavares and others, etc.... You well know what my services and labors have been, and the enormous expenses I have incurred with the strong gatherings I have made, which have amounted since the beginning of the struggle to more than 18,700 [sic] men, and my name has appeared little, because I do not have the skill to assert my services. I also send you 2 official letters from Araújo Ribeiro, 2 from Bento Manuel, 1 from Antero, 2 from Chagas, 1 from Brigadier Carneiro, two orders of the day which somewhat speak in my favor; and above all a letter from Barreto, which I think cannot be said better of any man; and I do not send the others as they seem to me sufficient, and I need the other documents. One of the orders of the day is to show that I commanded a brigade when I presented myself as a prisoner, which was also gathered by me. And the other to show the distinction with which President Elzeário treats me there, etc.. In short, you know best what you should do in view of the weak notes I make to you, and of what you yourself know; I ask you, however, earnestly, to handle this arrangement with the greatest promptness and energy it deserves.\n\nYour prosperity is much wished by he who is and will always be your sincere and obliged brother, Theseus\n\nNota Bene Luís Palmeiro writes me the letter which I send you enclosed and that of Minister Almeida, requesting the representation I gave to the Chamber, which is in your possession; therefore send it to me as well as the letters of Almeida and Palmeiro which are to be seen by you.\n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho. A. Varela"
