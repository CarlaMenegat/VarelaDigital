  "translation": "Before Your Excellency Antônio José de Abreu, trusting that fair and impartial justice will be rendered, in light of the arbitrary decision made against the appellant by the current Judge of Law of the District of Piratini, as will be demonstrated.\n\nFollowing the intestate death of the foreigner José Augusto Ledek, that judge began to proceed with the gathering of the assets, depositing them in the hands of a custodian in ... September of the current year, document no. 1, failing to appoint a Curator for the estate at that time, which he only did after several days, with that appointment falling upon the appellant, who took an oath as evidenced in the aforementioned document.\n\nIn this situation, recognizing that it was his duty, according to the laws in force, to manage the estate's assets, the appellant requested from that judge the delivery and administration of said assets, since by that term he had signed he became responsible for any fraud or omission on his part (document no. 2).\n\nAnd when the appellant expected that such a request would be granted as it was in accordance with the law, that judge, disregarding it, ordered that the respective proceedings be concluded; and before granting the appellant his request, he issued in the said proceedings the dispatch found in document no. 1, by which he excluded the appellant from the position of Curator, a decision that harmed his reputation, because the frivolous pretext he alleged could not save him, since he was fully aware that the deposit had been made and that the custodian had been appointed long before the appellant was named Curator.\n\nTherefore, in light of the well-considered reasons, the appellant believes that that judge has committed a manifest injustice against him, and having no other recourse but to the authority of Your Excellency."
