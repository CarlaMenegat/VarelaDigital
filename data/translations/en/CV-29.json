  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nBefore Your Excellency Antônio José de Abreu, trusting that fair and impartial justice will be rendered to him, in view of the arbitrary decision rendered against the appellant by the current Judge of Law of the District of Piratini, as he proceeds to demonstrate.\n\nHaving died intestate the foreigner José Augusto Ledek, that judge proceeded with the collection of the assets, depositing them in the possession of a custodian in ... of September of the current year, document no. 1, neglecting to appoint a Curator to the estate, which he only did after several days, appointing the appellant, who took the oath as evidenced by the said document.\n\nIn this state of affairs, recognizing that by virtue of the laws in force, the appellant was entitled to the administration of the inheritance assets, he requested from that judge the delivery and administration thereof, since by that term he had signed, he became responsible for any fraud or omission on his part (document no. 2).\n\nAnd when the appellant expected that this would be granted to him as it was in accordance with the law, that judge, disregarding it, through his oral order, caused the respective records to be forwarded to his conclusion; and before granting the appellant’s request, he issued in said records the order found in document no. 1, by which he removed the appellant from the post of Curator, an order which harmed his reputation, because the frivolous pretext he alleged could not save him, since he was not unaware that the deposit had been made, and the custodian appointed by him, long before the appellant was appointed Curator.\n\nTherefore, in view of the well-considered reasons, the appellant considers that that judge has manifestly done him injustice, and having no other recourse but to appeal to the authority of Your Excellency.\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nI esteem to receive, Piratini, October 2, 1841.  \nAntônio José de Abreu"
