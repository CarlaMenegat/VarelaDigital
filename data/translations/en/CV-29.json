  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nBefore Your Excellency Antônio José de Abreu, confident that just and impartial justice will be done to him, in view of the arbitrary decision rendered against the appellant by the current Judge of Law of the District of Piratini, as he proceeds to demonstrate.\n\nHaving died intestate the foreigner José Augusto Ledek, that judge proceeded to the collection of the assets, depositing them in the custody of a custodian on ... of September of the current year, document no. 1, neglecting to appoint a Curator for the dormant estate, which he only did after several days, the appointment falling to the appellant, who took the oath as evidenced by the aforementioned document.\n\nIn this state of affairs, recognizing that by virtue of the laws in force the administration of the inheritance's assets was incumbent upon him, the appellant requested from that judge the delivery and administration of them, since by that term he had signed he became responsible for any fraud or omission on his part (document no. 2).\n\nAnd when the appellant expected that this be granted to him as in accordance with the law, that judge, disregarding it, by his oral order caused the respective records to be escalated to his conclusion; and before granting the appellant’s request, he rendered in said records the order found in document no. 1, by which he excluded the appellant from the office of Curator, an order that damaged his reputation, because the frivolous pretext he alleged cannot save him, since he was not unaware that the deposit had been made, and that the custodian was appointed by him, well before the appellant was appointed Curator.\n\nIt is therefore in view of these reasoned grounds that the appellant considers that the said judge has caused him manifest injustice, and having nowhere else to appeal but to the authority of Your Excellency,\n\nYour Excellency\n\nI remain respectfully yours, Piratini, October 2, 1841. Antônio José de Abreu"
