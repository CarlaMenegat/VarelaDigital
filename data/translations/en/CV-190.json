  "translation": "My dear Bernardina  \nPorto Alegre, February 17, 1836.\n\nYesterday I wrote you a letter in the morning, and after having sent it, the Assembly decided to suspend several guarantees, recommending to the Vice-President, who took office in the afternoon, full authority to expel the anarchists from Rio Grande, from the North, and from other points of the Province; consequently, perhaps within these eight days a large division will have to pass there, and there will be great agitation among the heroes who have brought these misfortunes upon themselves and the innocents. It is to be supposed that this time the regressive januarians will be chastened, and that for this reason it will be possible to live with fewer enemies. In this consideration, and wishing to always conform to your will, because you deserve it, I will describe the establishment that I said I intended to rent. A house with many rooms, having a stretch of an upper floor, containing a tolerable room, two bedrooms, an office, and a mezzanine that corresponds to the room. Below there are rooms for guests, a coach house, pantry, dining room, and several other small rooms for storage. The kitchen and slave quarters are outside; courtyards enclosed on two sides of the house, and on one side there is a very lush olive tree. The farm extends along the margin of the Petim stream which, forming a perfect circle, offers a beautiful piece of land: about 300 orange trees that bear fruit, with countless other fruit shrubs from Europe and indigenous, symmetrically planted, combining the useful with the pleasant. In front, or on one side of the entrance, there is a famous plantation of pineapples, some banana trees, etc. At one end of the farm there is a house facing the road that serves as a store, where travelers and neighbors obtain necessities, leaving some profit. In the backyard there is the laundry, and water is drawn from the river for the kettle and other household uses. Mango trees, paddocks for calves and horses are nearby. About 400 fathoms away is the very well-built brick kiln, covered with tiles, with clay close by on the riverbank where tiles and bricks are unloaded for the boats, through a ramp that loads 3 to 4 thousand tiles or bricks at a time, since the boats cannot enter the shallows in summer. About 600 fathoms further is the charqueada already at the margin of the great bay below the White Rocks: it has a famous brick shed covered with tiles and with lodgings on one side; the grease processing place is small and next to it, as well as the mango trees and corrals. There is another building at the river mouth, called the customs house, because it is where the goods to be shipped are deposited and where those arriving for the house and neighbors are received. On the opposite side, in front of this house, there is a charqueada, woefully arranged. Three famous paddocks, almost all fenced with thorn bushes, offer all the accommodations for the animals serving the charqueada and the brick kiln; there slaughtering with a lasso takes place, but a crane will be convenient as there is house brick, beams, and small woods. Firewood for the brick kiln is abundant and almost inside it. The port on the lagoon side is not good; because besides the boats being far from the shore, needing to be loaded with barges or ramps, they suffer greatly with northeast, east, and southeast winds; however, there is no record of losses, etc. Jardim, about a quarter of a league, the same Jardim two leagues away, and the charqueadas of Barra also about two and a half leagues. The place is pleasant, one can raise plenty of cattle for cheese and butter for trade and consumption: also one can have a famous flock of sheep.\n\nNow, you being so accustomed to your mother, from whom you have never been apart, I greatly fear that this move to such a secluded place will bring you melancholy and resentments, very particularly when I am forced to come to the city, which is five leagues away. However, if these considerations on one hand distress me, on the other hand they cheer me up, remembering the labors in which I constantly see you engaged in managing a house transformed into an inn, and my agonies which must lessen, precisely because I separate myself a little from contact with men, always prone to harm me, as you know better than anyone.\n\nAdding to all this we have the godfather José Félix to instruct our children in the first letters and keep us company, enabling me, in rest, to better develop our interests without arousing anyone’s envy, and keeping the city at hand so afterwards our children may pursue higher studies.\n\nHere, my dear Bernardina, is faithfully the picture I have formed; but, as I said, wishing to act according to your will, I beg you to tell me frankly if you are troubled by this change, because everything can be arranged. It is worth reflecting more that here (I think) I will not be so harassed by my tyrant creditors, either for being outside their thirsty sight, or for being able to resist their cunning traps, and for other reasons you can understand. Besides, I also will not be employed in anything, and this not offending anyone’s envy or wounded self-love against me, my soul will not be anguished by the shots that have constantly been directed at me for this reason. To all these reasons can be added the resentment our Province has had to struggle with for some time, because of the political movements that have taken place. To the Eastern State almost all the people who prepare this reaction must be removed, under the pretext of Araújo Ribeiro’s taking office and the destruction of republics; but as soon as order begins to enter, there they are like this time appearing, scheming, stirring up, and disturbing public order, peace, and individual interests. This place is open and accessible from all sides; any assassin can easily enter, commit his crime and escape safely; and given such consideration, how can one live in peace? How can trust be reestablished? And how can one do business profitably? I suppose that more than one year in perfect peace will be indispensable for anything to be done, and that is why in the meantime I want to be employed with some small profit away from the clashes of those who know me and where I know them. Cipriano and Felizardo will not rent that charqueada, and what is convenient, even if little, to repair the buildings, fences, mango trees, and paddocks, and that product compensates what is given for this other lease. Finally, my ideas get confused in the rush of considerations assaulting me; therefore call your friend Chastan; with him, with Chaves whom you will also summon, and with our godfather José Félix, decide what you should do, and put it into execution immediately, notifying me by land for my management; because I will not go in person, fearing we may miss each other, if by the last decision of Araújo you put into practice what I suggested in the letters I sent you via Antunes and Vicente. The acrimony of the people on the expedition is extraordinary; if you can help anyone, do so, even those who promised to shave the heads of the farroupilhas, as is said here. My heart beats strongly when I consider the evils those three settlements have dared against the Province; God help me, and that is enough.\n\nHugs to our children, regards to all our family and friends; your father, godfather José Félix, and friend Chastan send their regards and you receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida  \nPelotas  \nBy special favor of the Illustrious Mr. Colonel."
