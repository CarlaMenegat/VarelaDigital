  "translation": "My dear Bernardina Porto Alegre, February 17, 1836.\n\nYesterday I sent you a letter in the morning, and after having left, the Assembly decided to suspend several guarantees, recommending to the Vice-president, who took office in the afternoon, all the efficacy to expel the anarchists from Rio Grande, this one, from the North and other points of the Province; as a consequence, perhaps within these eight days a large division will have to pass there, and there will be great agitation among the heroes who brought upon themselves and the innocent more of these misfortunes. It is to be supposed that this time the regressive Januarians will be taught a lesson, and that therefore one can live with fewer enemies. In this consideration, and wishing to always conform to your will, because you deserve it, I will describe the establishment I told you I intended to lease. A house with many rooms, having a stretch of upper floor, containing a decent room, two alcoves, an office, and an attic that corresponds with the room. Below, there are rooms for guests, a carriage house, pantry, dining room, and several other small rooms for storage. The kitchen and rooms for slaves are outside; courtyards enclosed on two sides of the house, and on one is seen a heavily laden leafy olive tree. The estate accompanies the bank of the Petim stream which, forming a perfect circle, offers a scenic terrain: close to 300 orange trees that bear fruit, with countless other fruit bushes from Europe and indigenous, symmetrically planted, combining the useful with the pleasant. In front, or on one side of the entrance, there is a famous pineapple plantation, some banana trees, etc. At one end of the estate, there is a house facing the road that serves as a shop, where passengers and neighbors obtain necessities leaving some profit. In the yard is the laundry, and water is taken from the river for cooking and other household services. Mango trees, paddocks for calves and horses are adjacent. About 400 fathoms away is a pottery well built, covered with tiles, with clay nearby on the riverbank from where tiles and bricks are dispatched for the yachts, through a chute that loads each time from 3 to 4,000 tiles or bricks, since the yachts cannot enter the shallows of summer. From there 600 fathoms away is the jerky factory already on the bank of the large cove below the White Rocks: it has a famous brick shed covered with tiles, and with lodgings on one side; the grease processing place in small scale is immediate, as well as the mango trees and corrals. There is another building at the river mouth, called the customs house, because it is there where goods to be shipped are deposited and where those arriving for home and neighbors are received. On the opposite side opposite this house there is a jerky factory, frightfully arranged. Three famous paddocks, almost all fenced with thorns, offer all the rooms for animals serving the jerky factory and the pottery: there it is slaughtered with a lasso, but a crane will be in place having house bricks, rafters, and small woods. Wood for the pottery is abundant; and it is almost within it. The port on the lake side is not good; because besides the yachts staying away from the land, needing to be loaded onto barges or chutes, they suffer a lot from Northeast, East and Southeast winds: however it is not known for losses, etc... The garden, about a quarter of a league, the same garden two leagues away, and the jerky factories at the Bar also about two and a half leagues. The place is pleasant, one can raise plenty of cattle for cheese and butter for business and consumption: one can also have a fine flock of sheep.\n\nNow, being so accustomed to your mother, from whom you have never parted, I fear much that this move to such a remote place will suggest melancholy and resentments, very particularly when I am forced to come to the city, which is five leagues away. However, if these considerations on one hand distress me, on the other they also encourage me, remembering the labors in which I continually see you in the management of a house transformed into an inn, and my agonies which must lessen because of that very separation from contact with men, always prone to harm me, as you better than anyone know.\n\nAdded to all this we have godfather José Félix to instruct our children in the basics and keep us company, being able, in rest, to better develop our interests without exciting anyone's envy, and having the city at hand so that later our children may pursue higher studies.\n\nHere, my dear Bernardina, is faithfully the picture I have made; but as I said, wishing to go along with your will, I beg you to tell me frankly if you feel dragged to this change, because everything can be reconciled. It ought to be reflected that here (I think) I will not be so harassed by my tyrant creditors, already for being out of their thirsty sight, already for being able to resist their crafty traps, and for other reasons you can understand. Besides, I also will not be employed in anything, and this not challenging the envy and wounded self-love of anyone against me, my soul will not be anguished by the shots that have constantly been directed at me for this respect. To all these reasons can be added the resentment that our Province has had to struggle with for a time, because of the political movements that have taken place. To the Eastern State almost all the people who prepare this reaction must go away, under the pretext of the possession of Araújo Ribeiro and the destruction of republics; but immediately when order is being restored, they appear again, scheming, agitating, and disturbing public order, quiet, and individual interests. That place is open and accessible from all sides, any assassin can easily enter, commit his crime and escape safely; and considering such reflection, how can one live tranquilly? How to restore confidence? And how to trade profitably? I suppose more than a year in perfect peace will be indispensable for something to be done, and that is why in the meantime I wish to employ myself with some small profit out of the clashes of those who know me and where I know them. Cipriano and Felizardo will not agree to lease that jerky factory, and what is convenient, even if little, for repairing the buildings, fences, mango trees and paddocks, and that product compensates for what is given for this other lease. Finally, my ideas become confused in the rush of considerations that assail me; therefore summon our friend Chastan; with him, with Chaves whom you will also call and with our godfather José Félix, agree on what you should do, and put it immediately into execution, informing me by land for my government; for I will not go in person, because I fear that we might miss each other if by the last deliberation of Araújo you put into practice what I hinted in those I directed to you by Antunes and Vicente. The sourness of the people who follow the expedition is extraordinary; if you can influence anyone, do so, even those who promised to shave the heads of the farroupilhas, as has been said here. My heart beats strongly when I consider the harms that these three settlements have challenged against the Province; God help me, and enough.\n\nGreetings to our children, visits to all our people and friends; your father, godfather José Félix and friend Chastan who take this as their own and you receive the heart of Almeida\n\nLady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas. By special grace of the Illustrious Colonel."
