  "translation": "Yesterday I wrote you a letter in the morning, and after deliberation, the Assembly decided to suspend various guarantees and to recommend to the Vice President, who took office in the afternoon, all necessary measures to expel the anarchists from Rio Grande, from the North, and from other points in the Province; as a consequence, perhaps in these eight days a large division will pass through there, and there will be great agitation among the heroes who have brought these misfortunes upon themselves and the innocent. It is to be hoped that this time the regressive januaries will learn their lesson, and because of that, it may be possible to live with fewer enemies. In this reflection, and wishing to always conform to your wishes, because you deserve it, I will describe the establishment I told you I intended to rent. A house with many rooms, having a set of elevated floors, containing a tolerable living room, two bedrooms, an office, and an attic that corresponds with the living room. Below, there are rooms for guests, stables, a pantry, a dining room, and various other cubicles for storage. The kitchen and quarters for slaves are exterior; enclosed patios are on two sides of the house, and in one grows a very lush olive tree. The estate runs alongside the banks of the Petim stream, which forms a perfect circle and offers attractive land: about 300 orange trees, which bear fruit, with countless other fruiting shrubs from Europe and indigenous species, symmetrically planted, unites the useful with the pleasant. In front or on one side of the entrance, there is a famous pineapple plantation, some banana trees, etc. At one end of the estate, there is a house facing the road that serves as a shop, where travelers and neighbors can get what they need, providing some profit. In the yard is the washing area, and water is drawn from the river for the pot and other household needs. Mango trees, pastures for calves and horses are nearby. About 400 fathoms from here, there is a well-built brick kiln covered with tiles, with clay nearby on the riverbank, from where tiles and bricks are unloaded for the yachts, through a flat-bottomed boat that carries 3,000 to 4,000 tiles or bricks at a time, since the yachts cannot enter during the low summer tides. Six hundred fathoms from there is the charqueada already on the banks of the large cove below the Pedras Brancas: this has a famous brick warehouse covered with tiles, and with lodgings on one side; the pigsty is close, as are the mango trees and pens. There is also another building at the river's mouth, which they call customs house, as it is where items are deposited for shipment and where goods coming to the house and neighbors are received. On the opposite side in front of this house, there is a charqueada, well-arranged. Three famous pastures, almost all surrounded by thorn, provide ample space for the animals serving the charqueada and the kiln: there they catch cattle, but a crane will be accounted for when there are house bricks, rafters, and small woods. Firewood for the kiln is abundant and almost within it. The port by the Lagoon is not good; because besides the yachts being far from shore, requiring them to be loaded onto batelões or flat-bottomed boats, they suffer greatly from Northeasters, Easterly, and Southwesterly winds: however, there are no reports of losses, etc. Garden, about a quarter of a league, the same garden two leagues, and the charqueadas at the Barra also about two and a half leagues. The place is pleasant, one can raise a lot of cattle for cheese and butter operations and consumption: one can also have a famous flock of sheep.\n\nNow, as you are so used to your mother, from whom you have never parted, I fear greatly that this change to such a removed place may suggest melancholy and spite, particularly when I am forced to go to the city, which is five leagues away. However, while these thoughts trouble me on one hand, they also encourage me on the other, reminding me of the struggles in which I continuously see you engaged in managing a house turned into an inn, and my agonies that must lessen just because I am separating a bit from the contact with men, always inclined to do me harm, as you know better than anyone.\n\nAdditionally, we have godfather José Félix to teach our children the basics and keep us company, allowing me, in peace, to better develop our interests without stirring anyone's envy, and keeping the city within reach for our children to pursue higher studies later.\n\nHere, dear Bernardina, is the faithful picture I make for myself; but, as I said, wishing to align with your will, I ask you to tell me frankly if you are forcing yourself to accept this change, for everything can be reconciled. It is necessary to contemplate that here (I think) I shall not be so harassed by my tyrant creditors, already for being out of their thirsty sight, already for being able to resist their crafty traps, and already for other reasons that you can understand. Furthermore, I will not be employed in anything, and thus, not provoking anyone's envy or offended vanity against me, my soul will not be tormented by the shots that have constantly been directed at me in this regard. To all these reasons, one can add the resentment that our Province has had to endure for some time, because of the political movements that have taken place. For the Eastern State, almost all the people preparing this reaction will have to distance themselves, under the pretext of Araújo Ribeiro's possession and the destruction of republics; but as soon as order is reestablished, they will be appearing again like this time, intriguing, agitating, and disturbing public order, individual peace, and interests. That place is open and accessible from all sides, any murderer can easily enter, commit his crime and escape safely; and how, in view of such consideration, can one live peacefully? How to restore trust? And how to negotiate profitably? I suppose that more than a year of perfect peace will be indispensable to accomplish anything, and that is why in the meantime, I wish to engage in some small profitable endeavor away from the shocks of those who know me and where I know them. Cipriano and Felizardo will not allow that charqueada to be rented, and what is fitting, even if it is little, to keep repairing the buildings, pastures, mango trees, and pens, and that yield offsets what is given for this other lease. Finally, my ideas get confused in the whirlwind of considerations that assail me; so send for friend Chastan; with him, along with Chaves whom you should also call, and with our godfather José Félix, settle on what you should do, and put it into action, notifying me by land for my governance; for I will not go in person, because I fear that we will miss each other, if by the last decision of Araújo you put into practice what I hinted at in the letters I sent you through Antunes and Vicente. The bitterness of the people still on the expedition is extraordinary; if you can help someone, do so, even those people who promised to shave the heads of the farroupilhas, as we have here. My heart beats strongly when I think of the evils that those three settlements have challenged against the Province; God help me, and that is enough."
