  "translation": "A general upheaval in all enemy forces, and at various points in the State, indicates the result of a combined plan against the freedom and independence of the continental people. Therefore, the unexpected appearance of some imperial groups in the most accessible places, along with their horrendous atrocities, confirms this truth: a sufficient and powerful reason to develop, with the greatest energy, the effective means to thwart their machinations.\n\nYour Excellency, Left Division, not excluding a single man who can ride a horse, suspending all orders, regardless of their authority, even those more absolute, because the crisis demands and determines as such.\n\nYou will also order the mobilization of all available cavalry, taking note of the owners’ names and the number of horses at their disposal, so that when they are returned, the missing ones may be compensated by the national treasury, which the government expects from the activity and patriotism of Your Excellency."
