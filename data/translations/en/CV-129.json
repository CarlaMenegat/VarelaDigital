  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nA general upheaval in all enemy forces, and at various points in the State, indicates the result of a combined plan against the freedom and independence of the continental people; furthermore, the unexpected appearance of some imperial groups in the most easily accessible places, along with their horrendous atrocities, confirms this truth: a sufficient and powerful reason to vigorously develop effective means to thwart their machinations.\n\nYour Lordship of the Left Division, without exempting a single man capable of riding a horse, shall suspend all decrees, regardless of the authority from which they originate, even the most absolute ones, because the crisis so demands and dictates.\n\nYou shall also command the rounding up of all mounted animals available, recording the names of their owners and the number of horses supplied, so that when they are returned, those missing may be paid for by the national treasury, which the government expects from the activity and patriotism of Your Lordship.\n\nGod preserve Your Lordship.\n\nSecretary of War Affairs in Caçapava, December 19, 1839.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nOfficial letter from the Excellent Minister of War dated December 19, received on the 25th of the same month. Circular.\n\nPresidency Secretariat of the Republic  \nInácio José de Oliveira Guimarães, Chief General of Police."
