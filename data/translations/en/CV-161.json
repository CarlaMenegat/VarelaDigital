  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nOn the 6th of the current month, with the date of the same, I received an official letter from Your Lordship regarding Serra dos Tapes, to the left of the arroyo of Pelotas, and, in compliance with your orders, I went on the 7th to the residence of citizen Serafim Pereira Rosa, who without any doubt offered to deliver to me the instructions currently in my possession; and in this way I believe I have done what was required, thus avoiding violence against the heads of families, cutting off the intrigue which lacked nothing to reach its peak. The instructions that I see I cannot put into execution in some articles, due to the impossibility of the inhabitants existing in the district, and it is necessary that Your Lordship\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nAndrade, July 8, 1836.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Domingos José de Almeida, Colonel Chief of Legion.  \nJoão Alexandre, Police Officer."
