  "translation": "On the 6th of the current month, with the same date, I received a letter from Your Excellency Serra dos Tapes, on the left of the Arroio de Pelotas, and, to comply with your orders, I went on the 7th to the residence of the citizen Serafim Pereira Rosa, and he without any doubt offered to give me the instructions currently in my possession; and in this way, I believe I have done what I should, thus avoiding violence against heads of families, cutting off the intrigue that was on the verge of reaching its peak. The instructions I see, I cannot put into execution for some articles, due to the impossibility of the inhabitants currently in the district, and this is necessary for Your Excellency."
