  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir,\n\nOn the 6th of the current month, with the same date, I received a letter from Your Excellency regarding Serra dos Tapes, to the left of the arroyo of Pelotas, and, in compliance with your orders, on the 7th I went to the residence of the citizen Serafim Pereira Rosa, who without any doubt offered to deliver to me the instructions currently in my possession; and in this manner I believe I have done what was required, thus avoiding violence against the heads of families, cutting off intrigue which lacked nothing to bring it to its peak. The instructions I see I cannot put into execution in some articles, due to the impossibility of the inhabitants residing in the district, and this is necessary for Your Excellency.\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency.\n\nAndrade, July 8, 1836.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Domingos José de Almeida, Colonel Chief of the Legion.\n\nJoão Alexandre  \nPolice Officer."
