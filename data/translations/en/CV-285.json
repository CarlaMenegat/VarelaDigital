  "translation": "The undersigned Captain Roberto G. Bisley, Jerônimo Teixeira de Almeida, and Domingos José de Almeida, wishing to cooperate with all their strength in the prompt recognition of the Republic of Rio Grande do Sul, have agreed to arm a vessel at their expense to engage in privateering in the high seas in the waters of the bar of Rio Grande, against the vessels of the subjects of the Emperor of Brazil, extracting from it, at the same time, all the advantages that can be gleaned, and for such purposes they mutually bind themselves to the conditions set forth in the following articles:\n\nArticle 1. — For the purchase of a vessel that will cruise in the waters of the bar of Rio Grande to harass the subjects of the Government of Brazil, its equipment, armament, and advances to the crew, each partner is obligated to deliver in Montevideo to partner Captain Roberto Bisley, or to whom he designates, the sum of 750 patacões in sound currency.\n\nArticle 2. — It is the responsibility of said partner Captain Roberto to purchase the mentioned vessel, its equipment and armament, as well as to command it, direct the captures, and everything else concerning the privateering, according to the Regulation of November 12, 1836, and other instructions received with his letter patent from this Republic; and for the work of armament and equipment, he will not require anything, but in the captures, as commander of the privateer, he will take five percent in addition to the share he is entitled to as armorer.\n\nArticle 3. — It is the responsibility of partner Jerônimo to head to Mostardas as soon as he has notice of the purchase and departure of the privateer vessel, to have sentries on the coast to observe where the capture runs aground, to promote its unloading, to manage the effects of the cargo, and to maintain clear records and notices to the other partners.\n\nArticle 4. — It is the responsibility of partner Almeida to arrange with the Government of the Republic the orders and provisions necessary for the protection of the unloading of captures, the sale of the goods contained therein, and the payment for those sold to the State, in addition to directing the notices to Montevideo.\n\nArticle 5. — All captures containing dry goods or military articles will be sent to Mostardas, to run aground at the contracted point; the other captures will be given a suitable destination by the commander, sinking those that are of no use.\n\nArticle 6. — Half of the proceeds from the captures, once settled, will be promptly delivered to the commander and capturers.\n\nArticle 7. — The other half will be handed over to the armorers, who will divide it into equal parts.\n\nArticle 8. — Partner Jerônimo is responsible for the effects of the captures he disposes of, and partner Captain Roberto is likewise responsible for the captures destined for other points, and must give repeated notices.\n\nAnd thus, in agreement, they sign three copies of this content, so that each partner may keep their own."
