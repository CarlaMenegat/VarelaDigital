  "translation": "My dear old woman of my heart. Porto Alegre, April 25, 1835.\n\nThis is the fourth letter I have sent to you, and I have truly felt the lack of receiving one from you yet, to know how you and our dear children are doing, whom I bless and embrace with the deepest longing. We have scarcely made progress in the three ordinary sessions, and I only await an opportunity to present a bill concerning the circulating medium, to return. I have been much attended to, and this has occupied me to such an extent that I have not even been able to look after the yacht, and for that reason Filipe still goes today. On the 1st yacht, send me 100 tongues. Once again, I recommend that you admonish godfather Rolino to be very vigilant with the slaves, ensure harmony among everyone, not to fail to receive livestock for the borders, even if for less than their run value, to set a watch on the manioc, and in case of failures, to take care of the planting on the small farm, however following first and foremost what cousin Cipriano determines. Send me a small bottle of Custódia’s medicine and the recipe for making it, as it is for a compatriot of mine who has served me well and suffers from asthma.\n\nReceive, my esteemed old woman, the longing heart of Your old lover who loves you very much, Almeida.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida - Pelotas."
