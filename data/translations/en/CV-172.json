  "translation": "This is the fourth letter I am addressing to you, and I truly feel the absence of any correspondence from you, to know how you are doing and our dear children, whom I bless and embrace with the warmest longing. We have made little progress in the three ordinary sessions, and I am only waiting for an opportunity to present a bill regarding the circulating medium, in order to return. I have been very occupied, and this has kept me so busy that I have not even been able to look at the yacht, and that is why Filipe is still departing today. In the first yacht, he sends me 100 tongues. Again, I urge you to admonish Compadre Rolino to be very vigilant with the slaves, to ensure harmony among all, not to refuse the cattle for expenses, even if it means accepting less than the usual amount, to keep watch over the cassava, and to take care of the plantation in the chácara, following, however, in the first place, whatever Cousin Cipriano decides. Send me a little vial of Custódia's medicine and the recipe to make it, as it is for a fellow countryman of mine who has been very helpful to me and suffers from asthma."
