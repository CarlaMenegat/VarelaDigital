  "translation": "My dear old woman of my heart. Porto Alegre, April 25, 1835.\n\nThis is the fourth letter I have written to you, and I have truly felt not yet having any from you, to know how you are and our dear children, whom I bless and embrace with the most lively longing. We have made little progress in the three ordinary sessions, and I only hope for an opportunity to present a bill on the circulating medium, to return. I have been much attended to, and that has kept me so busy that I have not even been able to look at the yacht, and for that reason Filipe is still going today. On the 1st yacht, send me 100 tongues. Again I recommend that you admonish godfather Rolino to be very vigilant with the slaves, harmony among all, that he does not fail to receive cattle by the coast, even if for less than the going price, that he keeps watch over the manioc and that in the shortcomings he takes care of the plantation of the small farm, however following primarily what cousin Cipriano determines. Send me a little bottle of Custódia’s medicine and the recipe to make it, as it is for a compatriot of mine who has served me well and suffers from asthma.\n\nReceive, my estimable old woman, the longing heart of your old lover who values you greatly, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida - Pelotas."
