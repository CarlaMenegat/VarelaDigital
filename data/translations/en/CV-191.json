  "translation": "Your letters of the 3rd and 6th of this month, which I just received yesterday, did not dissipate the worries and anxieties that seeing you among an unruly horde has caused me, like that which with armed force attempts, under the pretext of possessing a frantic factionist, to overthrow the virtuous patriots who on the twentieth of September pulled our Province from the abyss to which those wicked, degenerate proteuses of regression intended to take it; but as I consider now at this hour Bento Gonçalves and his patriotic division, I am gradually able to breathe, etc., etc...\n\nPrepare now to receive more news, prepare finally to know that we are going to separate for a longer time and perhaps for more than two months.\n\nThe Chamber to which I belong, having decided to send a delegation to Rio to make known to the Central Government the tortuous and anarchic conduct of Araújo Ribeiro and to show the delicate state of the Province, appointed me and Dr. Marciano for such a commission: I wanted to excuse myself, but beginning by saying that despite finding myself here, my heart was with you and our children, my voice deserted me and a torrent of tears streaming from my eyes left me unable to say anything until the end of the session. Many of my colleagues also cried, and having postponed my excuse until yesterday, reasons arose that force me to make yet another sacrifice for my fellow citizens, for you, and for our children. Yes; I am heading to Rio, and may my efforts be crowned according to my wishes. Comfort yourself, Bernardina, with the memory of the pure intentions that compel me to undertake such a long and uncomfortable journey; a journey that, if not risky, is at least thorny due to the traps.\n\nAs soon as you receive this, send me compadre Rolino, as I really need to speak with him before I depart. He can bring me some horses of my breed if they are fat, the blanket for my saddle, and the Catraio, as I may take it too.\n\nIf there are any shirts, send me those, as well as the straw hat; but let it all come as soon as possible and with someone whom Bento Gonçalves should send to me. Upon the return of compadre Rolino, I will write to friends Chastan, compadre Cipriano, Chevalier, to whom you will show this letter as though it were their own, as well as to friend Chaves, as I offer all my services for that place to everyone. As soon as compadre arrives at the Garden, have him call me and bring my pistols.\n\nIt is possible that my trip may still be revoked, so do not distress yourself too much for now."
