  "translation": "My dear Bernardina  \nPorto Alegre, February 23, 1836.\n\nYour letters of the 3rd and 6th of this month, which I received only yesterday, have not dispelled the cares and anxieties caused by seeing you in the midst of a wild horde, such as that which with armed hand tries, under the pretext of possessing a frantic factionist, to overthrow the virtuous patriots who on the twentieth of September tore our Province from the abyss to which they intended to lead it, like those wicked, equally degenerate Proteus of regressiveness; but as at this hour I consider Bento Gonçalves and his patriotic division, little by little I am breathing easier, etc., etc...\n\nPrepare yourself now to receive another blow, prepare finally to know that we are going to separate for farther away and perhaps for more than two months.\n\nThe Chamber to which I belong, having deliberated to send a deputation to Rio to present to the Central Government the tortuous and anarchic conduct of Araújo Ribeiro and to show the delicate state of the Province, appointed me and Dr. Marciano for such commission: I wished to excuse myself, but beginning by saying that despite being here, my heart was with you and our children, my voice failed me and a torrent of tears springing from my eyes put me in a state of saying nothing until the end of the session. Many of my colleagues also cried, and leaving my excuse for yesterday, reasons appeared that compel me to make this sacrifice for my compatriots, for you and for our children. Yes; I am going to Rio, and may my efforts be crowned to the extent of my desires. Comfort yourself, Bernardina, with the remembrance of the pure intentions that I nurture and that oblige me to such a long and inconvenient journey; a journey, if not risky, at least thorny due to the pitfalls.\n\nSend me immediately upon receiving this, compadre Rolino, for I very much need to speak with him before leaving. Through him some horses from my stable may come to me if they are fat, the covering of my saddle, and the Catraio, because I might take him too.\n\nIf there are some shirts, send me those, as well as the straw hat; but let him come as soon as possible and with a letter that Bento Gonçalves owes me. Upon the return of compadre Rolino is when I will write to friends Chastan, compadre Cipriano, Chevalier, to whom you will show this letter and have them consider it theirs, as well as to friend Chaves, for I offer all of them my services for that place. As soon as compadre arrives at Jardim, let him summon me and bring the pistols.\n\nIt may be that my departure will still be revoked, so do not distress yourself too much for now.\n\nGiving a thousand embraces to our children, bless them in my name in the Creator’s name; compadre José Félix, let this be for him, and your mother a very tight embrace, and farewell which I can no longer give.  \nYours, Almeida.\n\nYesterday I finished closing the lease deal of the establishment I mentioned to you because of what you told me in your letter of the 6th of this month.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida.  \nPelotas."
