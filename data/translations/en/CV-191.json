  "translation": "My dear Bernardina Porto Alegre, February 23, 1836.\n\nYour letters of the 3rd and 6th of this month, which I only received yesterday, have not dispelled the worries and anxieties caused to me by seeing you in the midst of an unrestrained horde, such as that which with armed arms tries, under the pretext of possessing a frantic factionist, to overthrow the virtuous patriots who on the twentieth of September wrested our Province from the abyss into which they intended to lead it, like those perverse, degenerate proteus of regression; but as I now consider Bento Gonçalves and his patriotic division, I am gradually breathing easier, etc., etc...\n\nPrepare now to receive another blow, prepare at last to know that we are going to separate for farther away and perhaps for more than two months.\n\nThe Chamber to which I belong, having deliberated to send a deputation to Rio to expose to the Central Government the tortuous and anarchic conduct of Araújo Ribeiro and to show the delicate state of the Province, appointed me and Dr. Marciano for such commission: I wished to excuse myself, but beginning by saying that although I find myself here, my heart was between you and our children, my voice failed me and a torrent of tears springing from my eyes left me unable to say anything until the session's end. Many of my colleagues also wept, and leaving my excuse for yesterday, reasons appeared that compel me to make yet this sacrifice to my fellow provincials, to you and to our children. Yes; I go to Rio, and may my efforts be crowned as much as my desires. Comfort yourself, Bernardina, with the remembrance of the pure intentions I nurture and that oblige me to such a prolonged and uncomfortable journey; a journey if not risky, at least thorny because of the traps.\n\nSend me, immediately upon receiving this, the godfather Rolino, whom I very much need to speak to before departing. Through him some horses from my stable may come to me if they are fat, the blanket of my saddle and the Catraio, because I might take it as well.\n\nIf there are some shirts, send me those too, like the straw hat; but have them come as soon as possible and with a message that Bento Gonçalves must send me. On the compadre Rolino’s return, I will write to friends Chastan, compadre Cipriano, Chevalier, to whom you will show this letter and they shall consider it theirs, as well as to friend Chaves, for to all I offer my services for that place. The compadre, as soon as he arrives at Jardim, must call for me and bring me the pistols.\n\nIt may still be that my departure is revoked, and so do not worry too much yet.\n\nSending a thousand embraces to our children, for me bless them in the name of the Creator: godfather José Félix must consider this his, and your mother a tight embrace, and farewell since I can no longer continue. Yours, Almeida.\n\nYesterday I finished closing the lease deal of the establishment I spoke to you about because of what you told me in your letter of the 6th of this month.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
