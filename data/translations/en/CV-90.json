  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nHaving been quite disorganized, I have failed in my duty to respond to the letter of Your Lordship dated November 25 of this month; and as our comrades assured me that they participated in everything that was happening, that I should take charge of securing our frontier, and I was persuaded that this was so by those very same who asked me to send to Your Lordship at Ibicuí; one night Brigadier Bento Manuel joined me, bringing with him 30 men, and on another night Sergeant-Major Jacinto Guedes, bringing with him over one hundred men; this junction took place at Carvaraci, where I was with the few forces I had; we then immediately marched upon Mingote and Siqueira, where we lost 2 men and the enemy 9, my force’s commander having led the attack; Major Carneiro on the same march went upon Loureiro and I found no one there because, on the night Brigadier Bento Manuel was there, Loureiro, I believe having learned, retreated to the other side; because the following day we attacked Mingote and, on our return, we already found our deserters on the other side, which also happened the very same day that we attacked here; I do not explain more about treaties and plans because I asked Señor Prado, President of the Chamber, to explain to Your Lordship at the tax office. Even now I am preparing a batch of gunpowder to send to Your Lordship.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nCamp at Ibirapuitã, December 2, 1837.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira  \nColonel Commander of the Right Division\n\nJosé Inácio da Silva Abreu  \nLieutenant-Colonel Interim Commander of the Frontier"
