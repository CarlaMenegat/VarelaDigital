  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nHaving been rather distracted, I have neglected my duty in responding to the official letter from Your Excellency dated November 25 of this year, and as our companions assured me that they were reporting everything that was happening, that I should take care of securing our frontier, and I understood that it was so because those very individuals asked me to send to Your Excellency Ibicuí; on one night the Brigadier Bento Manuel joined me, bringing with him 30 men, and on another night Sergeant-major Jacinto Guedes, bringing with him more than one hundred men; this union took place at Carvaraci, where I was with the few forces I had; we immediately marched on Mingote and Siqueira, where we lost 2 men and the enemy 9, my force commander led the attack; Major Carneiro in the same march went against Loureiro but I did not find him because on the night of Brigadier Bento Manuel, Loureiro, I think upon learning, retreated to the other side, for the next day we attacked Mingote and already on our return we found our scattered men on the other side, which also occurred the same day we attacked here; I will not explain more about treaties and plans because I asked Mr. Prado, President of the Chamber, to explain to Your Excellency the treasury matters. Right now I am preparing a large quantity of gunpowder to send to Your Excellency.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.  \nField in Ibirapuitã, December 2, 1837.  \nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira, Colonel Commander of the Right Division.  \nJosé Inácio da Silva Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel Interim Commander of the Frontier."
