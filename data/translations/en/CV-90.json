  "translation": "Due to having been quite overwhelmed, I have failed in my duty to respond to the letter from Your Excellency dated November 25 of this year. As our companions assured me that they were reporting all that was happening, I took it upon myself to secure our border. I understood this to be the case from those who asked me to send to Your Excellency Ibicuí. One night, Brigadier Bento Manuel joined me, bringing with him 30 men, and the next day, Sergeant Major Jacinto Guedes joined, bringing along over a hundred men. This joining occurred in Carvaraci, where I found myself with the few forces I had. We soon marched towards Mingote and Siqueira, where we lost 2 men and the enemy lost 9, with the commander of my force who attacked being Major Carneiro. During the same march, he went towards Loureiro, but I did not find him because during the night Brigadier Bento Manuel was there, and Loureiro, I believe, learned of this and crossed to the other side. The next day, we attacked Mingote and found our lost men on the other side, which also happened on the same day we attacked here. I cannot elaborate further on the treaties and plans because I asked Mr. Prado, President of the Chamber, to explain them to Your Excellency regarding the collection. Right now, I am preparing a supply of gunpowder to send to Your Excellency."
