  "translation": "Illustrious Most Excellent Sir\n\nToday the men I had sent to São Martinho have arrived. They report that the Portinho has arrived in São Martinho and that Captain João Ferreira was sent to observe down there; today I myself will continue to see if I can beat it and then have about eight or ten more carts of goods brought that are in Santa Maria; the carts I sent to march to the army have been delayed because one of the spokes broke and the day after tomorrow without fail they should be at the Toropi pass.\n\nGod guard Your Excellency  \nInhamandá, July 18, 1841.\n\nIllustrious Most Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto  \nBrigadier Commander of the Army  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant Colonel"
