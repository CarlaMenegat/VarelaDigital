  "translation": "Most Illustrious Excellency Sir\n\nToday I received the dispatches that I had sent to São Martinho. They report that the Portinho arrived at São Martinho and that Captain João Ferreira was sent to observe down there; I myself will proceed today to see if I can attack it and then bring there about eight or ten more carriages with goods that are in Santa Maria; the carriages I ordered to march to the army have been delayed because the spokes of one of them broke and the day after tomorrow without fail they should be at the Toropi passage.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Inhamandá, July 18, 1841.\n\nMost Illustrious Excellency Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto. Brigadier Commander of the Army. Francisco Pedro de Abreu. Lieutenant-Colonel."
