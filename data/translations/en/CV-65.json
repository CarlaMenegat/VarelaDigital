  "translation": "Today I received the very ones I had sent to São Martinho. They report that Portinho has arrived in São Martinho and that Captain João Ferreira was sent to observe down below; today I will go to see if I can catch him and then arrange to bring in another 8 or 10 wagons of supplies that are in Santa Maria; the wagons I sent to the army have been delayed because one of them broke its spokes and the day after tomorrow, without fail, they should be at the Passo de Toropi."
