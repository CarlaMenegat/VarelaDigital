  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellency Sir\n\nToday I received the letters that I had sent to São Martinho. They report that the Portinho has arrived in São Martinho and that Captain João Ferreira had been sent to observe down there; I am going myself today to see if I can attack it and afterward to bring about eight or ten more carts of goods that are in Santa Maria; the carts that I sent to march to the army have been delayed because the spokes of one of them broke, and the day after tomorrow without fail they should be at the Toropi passage.\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency  \nInhamandá, July 18, 1841.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellency Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto, Brigadier Commander of the Army.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel."
