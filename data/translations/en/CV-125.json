  "translation": "It was presented to His Excellency Your Honor on the 16th of the current month, and informed of what Your Excellency His Excellency Your Honor Santa Maria has done the necessary actions that were required by the government; however, Your Excellency is advised that His Excellency Bento Manuel and Lieutenant Colonel Portinho, who at this time will be moving with the body under his command, but as is to be presumed may come through São Francisco or São Xavier, might find himself isolated.\n\nIn any case, see Your Excellency that Your Excellency Fontoura and the Justice of the Peace Porto assure me that the enemy force is a hundred and so men; therefore, the government expects that Your Excellency São Paulo, what force Your Excellency has.\n\nThe attached copy will inform Your Excellency Santa Maria, and as the enemy appears this side of São Gonçalo, perhaps there is some combination, and in this hypothesis it is necessary that everything is undertaken to hinder their planned junction. The 2nd Corps of Lancers may be available and could strengthen Your Excellency's force. Agostinho should move with some people through the Botucaraí Path, and Major Fontoura informed me that he was heading to Santa Maria, and it would be very convenient for them to act in accordance and combination. If in this municipality the meetings that were initiated take place, it might be possible to detach some force for that part, etc. Furrier Teodoro José de Medeiros, the bearer, will be partly satisfied with what he requests, as it cannot be fully met because the War Train is exhausted of many principal supplies."
