  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nIt was presented to Your Excellency on the 16th of this month, and, being made aware of what Your Excellency, His Excellency Your Excellency of Santa Maria, has taken the necessary measures to be set into action in such a case and that were at the government’s disposal; nevertheless, he recommends to Your Excellency, the Most Illustrious Bento Manuel, and to Lieutenant-Colonel Portinho, who at this hour will be moving with the body under his command, but as it is to be presumed he will come by São Francisco or São Xavier, he might end up isolated.\n\nIn any case, see to it, Your Excellency. Your Excellency Fontoura and the Justice of the Peace Porto assure me that the enemy force is about one hundred men; therefore the government expects from Your Excellency São Paulo, what force Your Excellency has.\n\nThe enclosed copy will inform Your Excellency of Santa Maria, and since the enemy appears below São Gonçalo, there might be some arrangement, and in this hypothesis it is necessary that everything be undertaken to frustrate the junction they are planning. The 2nd Corps of Lancers may possibly be available, and could reinforce Your Excellency’s force. Agostinho should ascend with some men by the Botucaraí Path, and Major Fontoura informed me that he was heading towards Santa Maria, and it would be very convenient for them to act in agreement and coordination. If meetings are held in this municipality as have begun, it might be possible to detach some force for that part, etc. The Corporal Teodoro José de Medeiros, bearer, will be partly satisfied with what he requests, not being able to fulfill it entirely because the War Train is exhausted of many essential supplies.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.\n\nSecretariat of War Affairs in Caçapava, December 18, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira.\n\nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nAnswered on the 21st of this month."
