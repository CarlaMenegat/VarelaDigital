  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nIt was presented to the Excellent Sir Your Lordship on the 16th of the current month, and, having been informed of what Your Lordship His Excellency Your Lordship Santa Maria has done regarding the measures that in such a case were proper to be put into action and which were at the disposal of the government; however, Your Lordship Excellent Bento Manuel and Lieutenant-Colonel Portinho, who at this hour will be in motion with the body under his command, are recommended, but as is to be presumed, he will come by São Francisco or São Xavier, and perhaps he may become isolated.\n\nIn any case, see Your Lordship; Your Lordship Fontoura and the Justice of the Peace Porto assure me that the enemy force is about one hundred men; therefore, the government expects that Your Lordship São Paulo, what force does Your Lordship have?\n\nThe attached copy will inform Your Lordship Santa Maria, and since the enemy appears before São Gonçalo, perhaps there is some arrangement, and in this hypothesis it is necessary that everything be undertaken to thwart the junction they are planning. The 2nd Corps of Lancers may perhaps be available, and may reinforce the force of Your Lordship Agostinho who should ascend with some men by the Botucaraí Trail, and Major Fontoura informed me that he was heading for Santa Maria, and it would be most convenient that they act in agreement and combination. If in this municipality the meetings to which a beginning was given take place, it may be possible to detach some force for that part, etc. The Corporal Teodoro José de Medeiros, bearer, will be partially satisfied with what he requests, not entirely, because the War Train is exhausted of many principal supplies.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship\nSecretary of War Affairs in Caçapava, December 18, 1839\nMost Illustrious Sir João Antônio da Silveira\nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nAnswered on the 21st of the current month."
