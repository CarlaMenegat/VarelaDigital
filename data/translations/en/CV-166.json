  "translation": "Bagé, December 18, 1842. My dear husband of my heart.\n\nI received your letter of the 14th, which gave me great satisfaction; I cannot withhold from you the great joy I felt at Fontoura being defeated along with all his gang, for, my husband, I was very anxious about the business of the Assembly taking a bad turn, according to what was circulating here, on your behalf, knowing that that dog was your enemy and that of compadre Bento; see how I must have been.\n\nEven so, I recommend that you be very cautious with yourself, for one can never be too careful; Victorica arrived here today; the news of Fructo was already known here; see under what circumstances it would have happened against us; this grieves me because of you, because we cannot go to that province.\n\nI have not received anything from João da Cunha that I asked for, and as for the papers, I have already sent them to you. God willing, the horse will arrive there safely; Major Pires if he passes here; as for the syringe you told me my brother brought, it is a mistake of my clerk, it is a syringe of new invention.\n\nI am sending you the reply I had from João da Cunha; the horses of yours that compadre João Antônio I have already entrusted to uncle Luís; just now I had a messenger sent to my brother Joaquim with the news of Fructo's defeat, for when he passed here he had already hinted to me that this would happen.\n\nThe children send you many regards and ask for your blessing. From your wife who values you greatly and asks that you take every care, Bernardina Almeida.\n\nAnswered on December 28, 1842."
