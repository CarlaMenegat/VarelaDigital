  "translation": "I received your letter of the 14th with much satisfaction, and I cannot deprive you of the great joy I had from Fontoura going down and all his gang, for my husband, I was very distressed about the Assembly's business taking a bad turn, according to what was circulating here, for your sake, knowing that that big dog was your enemy and that of compadre Bento; see how I was feeling.\n\nI still recommend that you take all precautions regarding your person, as any caution is insufficient; Victorica arrived here today; the news of Fructo was already known here; see in what circumstance it could happen against us; this troubles me for your sake, that we cannot go to that province.\n\nI have not received anything I asked of João da Cunha, and as for the papers, I have already sent them to you. God willing, the horse will arrive safely; Major Pires will pass here; as for the cover you mentioned that my brother brought, it is a mistake of my clerk, it is a syringe of new invention.\n\nI am sending you a response I received from João da Cunha, your horses that compadre João Antônio I have already recommended to uncle Luís; just now I had a messenger, I sent word to my brother Joaquim about the defeat of Fructo, for when he passed here he had already made me see that this would happen."
