  "translation": "Bagé, December 18, 1842. My dear husband of my heart.\n\nI received your letter of the 14th, which gave me great satisfaction; I cannot deny you the great joy I felt that Fontoura and his entire gang were defeated, for, my husband, I was very distressed about the affairs of the Assembly taking a bad turn, according to what was said here, due to your involvement, knowing that that scoundrel was your enemy and that of compadre Bento; you can see how troubled I was.\n\nEven so, I advise you to be very cautious with yourself, for caution is never too much; Victorica arrived here today; the news about Fructo was already known here; think about the occasion on which it might have happened against us; this worries me because of you, that we cannot go to that province.\n\nI have not received anything I asked of João da Cunha, and regarding the papers, I have already sent them to you. May God grant that the horse arrives there safely; Major Pires will pass here; as for the syringe you told me my brother brought, it is a mistake by my clerk; it is a newly invented syringe.\n\nI am sending you the reply I received from João da Cunha. I have already entrusted your horses to uncle Luís through compadre João Antônio; just now I had a courier and sent word to my brother Joaquim about Fructo’s defeat, for when he passed here he had already shown me that this very thing would happen.\n\nThe children send you many regards and ask for your blessing. From your wife who esteems you very much and asks you to take every care, Bernardina Almeida.\n\nAnswered on December 28, 1842."
