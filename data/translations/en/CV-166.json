  "translation": "Bagé, December 18, 1842. My beloved husband of my heart.\n\nI received your letter of the 14th, from which I had great satisfaction; I cannot withhold from you the great joy I felt at Fontoura going down and all his gang, for, my husband, I was very distressed about the affairs of the Assembly taking a bad turn, as was being said here, on your account, knowing that that scoundrel was your enemy and that of godfather Bento; see how uneasy I was.\n\nEven so, I advise you to be very cautious with yourself, for caution is never enough; Victorica arrived here today; the news of Fructo was already known here; see in what circumstance it would have happened against us; this worries me on your behalf, and that we cannot go to that province.\n\nI did not receive anything from what I asked João da Cunha, and as for the papers, I have already sent them to you. May God wish that the horse arrives there safely; Major Pires to pass here; as for the syringe you told me that my brother brought, it is a mistake of my clerk, it is a newly invented syringe.\n\nI send you the reply I received from João da Cunha, your horses that godfather João Antônio I have already entrusted to uncle Luís; just now I had a messenger, I sent word to my brother Joaquim about Fructo's defeat, for when he passed here he had already warned me that this would happen.\n\nThe boys send you many regards and ask for your blessing. From your wife who values you greatly and asks you to take every care, Bernardina Almeida.\n\nAnswered on December 28, 1842."
