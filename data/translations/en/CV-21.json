  "translation": "The citizen Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu states that the State owes him the amount for the cattle listed in the attached document, and that, due to the current war in which the nation is involved, all means of subsistence for the petitioner and his numerous family have completely failed. He therefore requests that Your Excellency orders the payment of the amount in discounts of rights that he dispatches from his property, in any Collector's Office of the State, and wishing to be as little burdensome as possible to the Rio Grande State, offers the government the amount of six hundred breeding cattle as a contribution to this same debt.\n\nHe asks Your Excellency."
