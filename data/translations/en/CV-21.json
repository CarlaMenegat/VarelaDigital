  "translation": "The citizen Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu states that the State owes him the value of the cattle listed in the attached document, and that, due to the present war in which the nation finds itself involved, the means of subsistence have entirely failed for the Petitioner and his numerous family; therefore, he requests Your Excellency to order payment to him of the amount in discounts on duties of goods he ships from his property, at any Collectory of the State, and wishing the Petitioner to be as little burdensome as possible to the Rio Grande do Sul State, he offers freely to the government from this same debt the value of six hundred head of livestock.\n\nHe requests Your Excellency\n\nAntônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu  \nBagé, January 22, 1842.\n\nTo the Secretary of Finance, Bagé, [torn] January 1842.  \nProsecutor Fiscal Silva.\n\nTo the Accounting Office. We have read. Verified the attached document in the amount of 5:326$500 rs.:  \n197 steers — 4$500 = 886$500  \n247 cows — 3$200 = 796$800  \n3036 head of stock — 1$200 = 3:643$200  \nGeneral Treasury Accounting Office in Bagé, January 25, 1842.  \nInterim Accountant Viana\n\nHaving to put an end to the system of transactions through the Collectories, whose results weigh so horrifically today on the Treasury; with the government more concerned with the need to promptly pay debts long contracted for goods consumed by the army, as well as the urgent need to continue purchasing the same goods; it is not possible to immediately attend to the Petitioner as the payment demanded in discounts on duties of goods he plans to ship is not as slow as he imagines, as can be verified in many ways, as has happened, and since the sum demanded by the Petitioner is large, this would be to accumulate a new embarrassment among the many that currently paralyze our financial state; however, wishing the government to reconcile as much as possible the private good with public demands, the Petitioner will be attended to opportunely, granting him a discount on a part of these shipments he intends to make, which will be verified at the Treasury and no longer at any Collectory.\n\nSecretary of Finance, Bagé, January 26, 1842.  \nFontoura."
