  "translation": "Citizen Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu states that the State owes him the value of the cattle listed in the attached document, and that, due to the present war in which the nation finds itself involved, the means of subsistence for the Petitioner and his numerous family have been entirely destroyed; he therefore requests that Your Excellency order payment of the amount owed from discounts on duties on goods he dispatches from his property, in any State Customs Office, and wishing to burden the Rio Grande State as little as possible, the Petitioner offers, free of charge, to the government the value of six hundred head of livestock from this same debt.\n\nHe petitions Your Excellency\n\nAntônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu  \nBagé, January 22, 1842.\n\nTo the Secretary of Finance, Bagé, [torn] January 1842.  \nFiscal Prosecutor Silva.\n\nTo the Accounting Department.  \nRead. Verified the attached document for the amount of 5:326$500 réis:  \n197 yearlings — 4$500 = 886$500  \n247 cows — 3$200 = 796$800  \n3036 head of livestock — 1$200 = 3:643$200  \n\nGeneral Treasury Accounting in Bagé, January 25, 1842.  \nInterim Accountant Viana\n\nAs it is necessary to put an end to the system of transactions through the Customs Offices, whose results weigh so horrifically today upon the Treasury; considering that the government is more engaged in the obligation to promptly pay debts long contracted for supplies consumed by the army, as well as the urgent need to continue purchasing the same supplies; it is not possible to attend immediately to the Petitioner since the payment demanded in discounts on rights for goods he intends to dispatch is not so slow as he imagines, as can be proven in many ways, as has occurred; and since the sum required by the Petitioner is large, this would accumulate a new burden on the many that currently paralyze our financial state; however, wishing the government to reconcile as much as possible private interests with public demands, the Petitioner will be attended to in due course, granting him in discount a part of those dispatches he believes to make, which will be verified in the Treasury and no longer in any Customs Office.  \nSecretary of Finance, Bagé, January 26, 1842.  \nFontoura."
