  "translation": "Companion and friend\n\nAs you entrusted me to send you some news that I might obtain about the enemy's movements, and I arrived yesterday at nine o'clock at night at this island where the guard of Ensign Cruz is located, I immediately presented myself to him or gave him my order; he showed me a letter he says is from a trusted spy, which letter warns that the enemy is gathering all the canoes in the village of Triunfo with the purpose of coming to attack the legal forces of the islands.\n\nIn view of this warning today I withdraw to your camp until the authorities send a boat to Lagoa dos Patos, the only measure that can save the cattle, guard and protect the families whom the force of necessity has compelled to live on the islands.\n\nYour subject, comrade and friend Antônio Pedro de Abreu  \nIsland of Corvo, May 19, 1839."
