  "translation": "Companion and friend\n\nAs you charged me to send you some news that I could obtain about the enemy movements, and I arrived at this island where the guard of Ensign Cruz is at nine o'clock last night, I immediately presented myself to him or deliver to him my order; he showed me a letter which he says is from a trusted spy, the letter warns that the enemy is gathering all the canoes in the town of Triunfo with the purpose of coming to attack the legal forces of the islands.\n\nIn view of this warning, today I withdraw to your camp until the authorities order a longboat to be sent to the Patos roadstead, the only measure that can save the cavalry, protect and shelter the families whom necessity has forced to live on the islands.\n\nYour subject, comrade and friend Antônio Pedro de Abreu  \nIsland of Corvo, May 19, 1839."
