  "translation": "As you tasked me with sending you any news I could gather regarding the movements of the enemy, and I arrived yesterday at nine o'clock in the evening to this island where the guard of Alferes Cruz is stationed, I immediately went to present myself to him or to deliver my official letter; he showed me a note that he claims is from a reliable spy, which warns that the enemy is gathering all the canoes in the village of Triunfo with the intention of attacking the legal forces of the islands.\n\nIn light of this warning, I am withdrawing today to join your camp until the authorities deem it necessary to send a launch to the bay of Patos, the only measure that can save the cavalry, protect, and shelter the families that have been forced by necessity to live across the islands."
