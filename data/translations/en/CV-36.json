  "translation": "Companion and friend\n\nAs you charged me to send you some news that I could obtain about the enemy's movements, and I arrived yesterday at nine o'clock at night at this island where the guard of Ensign Cruz is stationed, I immediately went to present myself to him or to deliver him my order; he showed me a letter that he says is from a trusted spy, which letter warns him that the enemy is gathering all the canoes in the town of Triunfo with the purpose of coming to attack the legal forces of the islands.\n\nIn view of this warning, today I am withdrawing to your camp until the authorities order a barge to the Patos strait, the only measure that can save the cattle, guard and shelter the families whom the force of necessities has constrained to live on the islands.\n\nYour subject, comrade and friend Antônio Pedro de Abreu  \nIsland of Corvo, May 19, 1839."
