  "translation": "Piratini, November 21, 1838. Friend Mr. Barroso\n\nAmong my old papers, which I happened to review yesterday, I came across the attached receipt, by which I see that the State owes Teodolindo only 344 hides, which at 960 réis each amount to 330$240, and not 426$240 as stated in the document that was issued to him, and presented to me to have other hides given to him.\n\nPlease look into this and tell me if it is I who am mistaken. I want to be heard regarding the same account before it is decided by the Court, etc., etc., etc...\n\nDo me the favor of giving me the list of the books I supplied for the Court, in order to arrange those documents at once, etc...\n\nYour obliged and affectionate friend Almeida"
