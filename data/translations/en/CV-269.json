  "translation": "Piratini, November 21, 1838. Friend Senhor Barroso\n\nAmong my old papers, which I happened to review yesterday, I found the attached receipt, by which I see that the State owes Teodolindo only 344 hides, which at 960 réis each produce 330$240, and not 426$240 as referred to in the document that was issued to him, and was presented to me to have other hides given to him.\n\nPlease therefore look into this, and tell me if it is I who am mistaken. I want to be heard on the account in question before it is decided by the Tribunal, etc., etc., etc…\n\nPlease do me the favor of providing the list of the books I supplied to the Tribunal, in order to arrange those documents at once, etc…\n\nYour obliged and affectionate friend Almeida"
