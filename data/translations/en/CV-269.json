  "translation": "Piratini, November 21, 1838. Friend Senhor Barroso\n\nAmong my old papers, which I happened to review yesterday, I found the receipt attached, by which I see that the State owes Teodolindo only 344 leathers, which at 960 réis each produce 330$240, and not 426$240 as stated in the document that was issued to him, and presented to me so that I would have other leathers given to him.\n\nPlease look into this, and tell me if I am the one who is mistaken. I want to be heard on this account before it is decided by the Tribunal, etc., etc., etc...\n\nKindly give me the list of the books I supplied to the Tribunal, so as to arrange these documents once and for all, etc...\n\nYour obliged and affectionate friend Almeida"
