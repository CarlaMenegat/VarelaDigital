  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir Domingos José de Almeida  \nPiratini, March 21, 1841.\n\nI gladly received your esteemed letter dated the 15th of this month, which greatly pleased me to know that you enjoyed good health and that you had made a successful journey; I informed the other gentlemen included in the same; here presently there is no news except for the report that Silva intends to escape. On Thursday, six sons of Dona Joaquina do Pavão and an old man called Rolim were captured in Pelotas.  \n\nI inform you that with Your Excellency’s departure, Sir José Mariano has not taken any measures; I believe we shall receive no more. I am convinced that this gentleman is acting against the government’s orders, according to the decrees and circulars that exist regarding this matter. Some days ago Your Excellency wrote to Mr. Erval, and I hope he will give prompt remedy. My family warmly commends itself to you, and I particularly do so, being\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s servant  \nAntônio José de Abreu  \n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Domingos José de Almeida, Minister of Finance Affairs.  \n[On the reverse] São Gabriel.\n\nAnswered April 11."
