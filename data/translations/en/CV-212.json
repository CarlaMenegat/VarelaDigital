  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nRecognizing the government that, for the prompt consolidation of the republican system, which the vast majority of the inhabitants of this State have solemnly proclaimed and sworn to defend, it is absolutely necessary to contract a loan, which, ensuring advantageous profit to the competitors, meets the needs of the war without burdening the already overtaxed peoples, and even to avoid violent measures, although applicable in the current circumstances, I have been entrusted with promoting the said loan, as can be seen from the attached decree dated the 29th of last May.\n\nFor this reason, I address Your Excellency for 1,000,000 réis in silver or gold, which will be paid within the term set by the said decree with a premium of one and a half percent per month, which shall begin to accrue from the day the document is delivered to this Secretariat in due form.\n\nFor the Treasury on this date, moreover in this city, Your Excellency will send Your Excellency\n\nPiratini, June 9, 1837.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida.\n\nPresidency Secretariat of the Republic Most Illustrious Sir Inácio de Oliveira Guimarães. Pelotas. From the Minister of State of the Affairs of the Treasury."
