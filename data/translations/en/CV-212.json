  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nAcknowledging the government which, for the prompt consolidation of the republican system that the vast majority of the inhabitants of this State have solemnly proclaimed and sworn to defend, it is absolutely necessary to contract a loan, which, while assuring advantageous profit to the bidders, will meet the needs of the war without burdening the peoples, already overtaxed, and even to avoid violent measures, although applicable in the current circumstances, I have been entrusted to promote the aforementioned loan, as may be seen from the decree appended of the 29th of May last.\n\nFor this reason I address Your Excellency for 1,000,000 réis in silver or gold, which will be paid to you within the term specified by the said decree with the premium of one and a half percent per month, which will begin to accrue from the day the document in proper form is delivered to this Secretariat.\n\nTo the Treasury on this date, indeed in this city, Your Excellency will send\n\nPiratini, June 9, 1837.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida.\n\nSecretariat of the Presidency of the Republic\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Inácio de Oliveira Guimarães\n\nPelotas\n\nFrom the Minister of State of the Affairs of the Treasury."
