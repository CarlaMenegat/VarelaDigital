  "translation": "Piratini, November 23, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nYesterday I did not write to you through Antônio because I first wanted to be informed of what happened in the Oriental State, in order to warn you about our departure, etc., etc., which I can now do.\n\nFructo crushed Oribe; he is gathering again without exception and it is likely that the other will do the same; in this state of things the campaign becomes impassable, due to the disturbances caused by the deserters from both parties and the malicious, who will not miss the opportunity to indulge their vices. In view of this I cannot leave now as I intend until I see the outcome of that matter; and even to go to that place only as a visit. The godfather Joaquim arranged less badly what was in Chaves's power: but they say he made Maia, D. Clara’s son-in-law, a partner in the estate, which displeases me, as I cannot with the same frankness take advantage of the favor of your brothers, should it be necessary; in short, our position becomes more and more burdensome: but patience to see how far this goes.\n\nBy the first bearer send me word of what you received sent by the late Chaves, so that I can look for what is missing from what he handed over to Varejão to send to me.\n\nRegards to the godfathers, and brothers in general, and you receive the heart of Yours, Almeida\n\nBernardino is doing much better, and Juca Neto recently passed away. The people of Rio Grande lost a treasure in him.\n\nMadam"
