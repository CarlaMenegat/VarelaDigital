  "translation": "Piratini, November 23, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nYesterday I did not write to you through Antônio because I wanted first to inform myself of what happened in the Eastern State, in order to warn you about our departure, etc., etc., which I can now do.\n\nFructo crushed Oribe; he gathers again without exception, and it is likely that the other will do the same; in this state of affairs the campaign becomes impassable, due to the disturbances caused by fugitives from both parties and the wicked, who will not miss the opportunity to indulge their vices. In view of this, I cannot leave yet as I intend until I see the outcome of that matter; and even to go to that place only for a visit. The godfather Joaquim arranged less badly what was in Chaves's power: but they say he made Maia, son-in-law of D. Clara, a partner in the farm, which has annoyed me, because I cannot with the same frankness take advantage of the favor of your brothers, should it be necessary; finally, our position becomes more and more burdensome: but patience, let us see how far this goes.\n\nBy the first bearer send me word of what you received sent by the late Chaves, so that I can look for what is missing from what he delivered to Varejão to send me.\n\nRegards to the godparents and siblings in general, and you receive the heart of Your Almeida\n\nBernardino is getting on with many improvements, and Juca Neto recently expired. The people from Rio Grande lost a treasure in him.\n\nMadam"
