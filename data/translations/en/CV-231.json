  "translation": "Piratini, November 23, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nYesterday I did not write to you through Antônio because I wanted first to inform myself of what happened in the Eastern State, in order to warn you about our departure, etc., etc., which I can already do.\n\nFructo shattered Oribe; he gathers again without exception and it is likely that he will do the same; in this state of affairs the campaign becomes impassable, due to the disturbances of the fugitives from both parties and the wicked, who will not miss the occasion to feed their vices. In view of this, I cannot leave now as I intend until I see the outcome of that matter; and even to go to that place only on a visit. The godfather Joaquim arranged less badly what was in Chaves’s power: but they say he made Maia, Dona Clara’s son-in-law, a partner in the farm, which has displeased me, because I cannot with the same frankness make use of the favor of your brothers, if it became necessary; finally, our position becomes more and more burdensome: but patience to see how far this goes.\n\nBy the first bearer send me word of what you received sent by the late Chaves, so that I can look for what is missing from what he delivered to Varejão to send to me.\n\nLonging to the godfathers, and brothers in general, and you receive the heart of Yours, Almeida\n\nBernardino is getting along with many improvements, and Juca Neto recently expired. The people from Rio Grande lost a treasure in him.\n\nMadam"
