  "translation": "Yesterday I didn’t write to you through Antônio because I wanted to first inform myself about what happened in the Eastern State, in order to warn you about our trip, etc., etc., which I can now do.\n\nFructo crushed Oribe; he is once again gathering everyone without exception, and it is likely that the other will do the same; in this state of affairs, the campaign becomes impassable, due to the disturbances caused by the fugitives from both parties and by the malevolent, who will not miss the chance to indulge in their vices. In light of this, I cannot leave as I intend until I see the outcome of that issue; and even to go to that place would only be for a visit. Compadre Joaquim has managed to arrange what was in the possession of Chaves with less difficulty: but they say he partnered with Maia, the son-in-law of D. Clara, which has displeased me, as I can no longer take advantage of the favor of your brothers with the same openness, should we need it; in short, our position becomes increasingly burdensome: however, patience to see how far this goes.\n\nThrough the first messenger, let me know what you received sent by the late Chaves, so that I can look for what remains of what he entrusted to Varejão to send to me."
