  "translation": "Piratini, November 15, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nBefore receiving your last letter I had already bought to send you 16 cubits of chintz and pieces of muslin alongside, the chintz for you and our daughters and the muslin for the boys' shirts: I hope you find everything to your liking. Today we had the pleasing news of the arrival, in the Porto Alegre area, of General Bento Gonçalves; this soothes my sorrows, and perhaps he may yet be of some service later on; for even from the rank of Colonel he had already requested and obtained resignation. I am living on in health; but, as you can imagine, very distressed for not being able to go to the neighboring State, on account of things there.\n\nI do not write more because of the messenger’s haste.\n\nRegards to the godparents, boys and everyone at home, and you receive the heart of Your faithful Almeida\n\nBy the first messenger send me all my military arrangements to see if I send them to be sold.\n\nMadam"
