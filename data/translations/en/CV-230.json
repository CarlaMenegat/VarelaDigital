  "translation": "Piratini, November 15, 1837. Dear Bernardina\n\nBefore receiving your last letter, I had already bought to send you the 16 cubits of chintz and pieces of morim together, the chintz for you and our daughters and the morim for the boys' shirts: I hope you find everything to your liking. Today we had the pleasing news of the arrival, at the Porto Alegre site, of General Bento Gonçalves; this alleviates my sorrows, and perhaps he may still be of some service later on; for even from the rank of Colonel he had already requested and obtained resignation. I am living in health; but, as you can imagine, very troubled for not being able to leave for the neighboring State, because of the matters there.\n\nI will not be more lengthy due to the haste of the bearer.\n\nGreetings to the godparents, children, and everyone at home, and you receive the heart of Your faithful Almeida\n\nBy the first bearer send me all my military arrangements to see if I can send them to be sold.\n\nMadam"
