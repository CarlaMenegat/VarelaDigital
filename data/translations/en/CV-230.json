  "translation": "Before receiving your last letter, I had already bought and prepared to send you 16 yards of calico and pieces of morim together—the calico for you and our daughters, and the morim for the boys’ shirts: I hope you find everything to your liking. Today we received the plausible news of the arrival, at the site of Porto Alegre, of General Bento Gonçalves; this alleviates my disappointments, and perhaps in the future he may still provide some services; for even from his position as Colonel, he had requested and obtained his resignation. I am managing to stay healthy; but, as you can imagine, I am very troubled by not being able to cross into the neighboring State, due to things happening there.\n\nI am not being more extensive due to the bearer’s urgency."
