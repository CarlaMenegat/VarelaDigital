  "translation": "On the 8th, Mr. Freire marches with the troops of the 1st Battalion to take command of this post when Your Excellency Mr. Freire will hand over two deserters from your battalion, which Your Excellency Flor, I am certain, is consistent with the conduct of the two captains of the 2nd Corps who have consistently failed to march according to the orders of their lieutenant-colonel, commander of the 2nd Corps, who ordered them to march without fail and to procure horses from neighboring areas for their march; therefore, it is necessary that Your Excellency Batista and Carcerero send them to Rio Grande under the orders of His Excellency."
