  "translation": "After the last letter I received from you, I haven't had the opportunity to write to you, which I am doing now. I cannot understand what Belém says about our slaves; but may God's will be done, let us live and everything will turn out fine.\n\nJosé Mariano de Matos arrived yesterday from Sandú, where he was with your brother João, who tells me he has made a lot of money supplying Fructo, and that he is about to become the master of Montevideo, which, if it happens, perhaps Señor Ramirez will not leave as he thinks.\n\nI am getting a little better from the scabs; but I am so overwhelmed with work that sometimes I don’t know where my head is, and furthermore, I find myself with the Justice portfolio and with the remount of the Army that is about to go into operation; I don't know if I will manage to leave the position gracefully: may God help me!"
