  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, September 3, 1838.\n\nAfter the last letter I received from you, I have not had the disposition to write to you, which I do now. I cannot comprehend what Belém says about our slaves; but be that as God wills, if we live, all will go well.\n\nYesterday José Mariano de Matos arrived from Sandú, where he was with your brother João, who told me he has earned a great deal of money supplying Fructo, and that he is soon to become master of Montevideo, which, if it happens, perhaps Señor Ramirez will not leave as he intends.\n\nI am recovering a little from the scabies; but so overwhelmed with work that sometimes I do not know where my head is, and moreover I am dealing with the Justice department and the army remounts, which are about to enter into operation; I do not know if I will manage honorably to leave the post: God help me!\n\nThe children are doing well, as are those there, whom you will embrace for me. Give regards to Señor Chaves, his wife, godmother Carlota, Manuel Campis and all in general; and receive yourself the heart of your Almeida.\n\nSeñora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. At the house of Señor José Rodrigues Chaves."
