  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, September 3, 1838.\n\nAfter the last letter I received from you, I have not found the opportunity to write to you, which I do now. I cannot grasp what Belém says about our slaves; but whatever God wills, may we live and all will be well.\n\nYesterday José Mariano de Matos arrived from Sandú, where he was with your brother João, who tells me he has earned a great deal of money supplying Fructo, and that he is soon to become master of Montevideo, which, if it happens, perhaps Señor Ramirez will not leave as he intends.\n\nI am getting a little better from the scabies; but I am so pressed with work that sometimes I do not know where I have my head, and moreover I find myself with the Justice office and with the army remounts that are going to come into operation; I do not know if I will manage to leave the post with honor: may God help me!\n\nThe children are doing well, as are those there, whom you will embrace for me. Give regards to Señor Chaves, his wife, godmother Carlota, Manuel Campis and all in general; and receive yourself the heart of your Almeida.\n\nTo Mrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. At the house of Señor José Rodrigues Chaves."
