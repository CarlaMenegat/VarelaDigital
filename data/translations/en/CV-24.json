We commend ourselves to your family; and to Your Mercy.\n\nYour friend and obliged servant, Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu.\n\nPostscript: Viana took documents from Your Mercy, one on March 15, 1835 — Amount of the yacht: 4:000$000\nSame on October 12, 1836 — Same of 5 slaves from the Jaguarão farm: José, field hand — 800$000\nJoaquim, said — 700$000\nAlberto, said — 600$000\nPedro, said — 700$000\nFermiano — 800$000\n\nSão Lourenço, April 20, 1845.
