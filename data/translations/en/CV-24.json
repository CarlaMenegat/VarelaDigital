  "translation": "May Your Mercy Saint Gabriel at the Crystal, that the liquidation commission ended on May 8, and that all documents that were legalized would be paid, and for which there was no limited amount; moreover, that such documents, to be properly legalized, depend on the signature of one of the generals, or the chief.\n\nTherefore, my two documents passed by Your Mercy Viana to Your Mercy, Your Mercy Viana took, I would have them initialed here by Bento, and would send them by the one who must leave on the 26th of this month; finally, the two documents that the same Viana took would be rendered ineffective once what I have passed to you above is verified.\n\nThus, I further ask you to tell me something if you know about such a collection. We recommend ourselves to your family; and to Your Mercy.\n\nPost Data Viana took documents passed by Your Mercy.\n\nSão Lourenço, April 20, 1845. Received on June 24, 1845. Responded on June 27, 1845."
