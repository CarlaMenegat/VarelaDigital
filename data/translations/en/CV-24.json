We recommend ourselves to your family; and to Your Mercy\n\nYour friend and obliged servant, Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu.\n\nPostscript: Viana took documents from Your Mercy\n\nOne on March 15, 1835 — Amount of the yacht: 4:000$000\n\nSame on October 12, 1836 — Same of 5 slaves from the Jaguarão estate: José, farmhand — 800$000; Joaquim, said — 700$000; Alberto, said — 600$000; Pedro, said — 700$000; Fermiano — 800$000\n\nSão Lourenço, April 20, 1845.
