  "translation": "Most Excellent Sir\n\nThere are people who, even if they suppose they will trouble you, do not do so as continuously as I do, because I am obliged by circumstances to bother you, not only out of my own respect but also for others, as happens now, that having asked the day before yesterday for assistance for the hospital, I now do so for myself; I am well certain of what you ordered to be told to me, however necessity obliges everything and therefore one patacão or two patacões is enough for one who has not a vintém nor anyone to ask it from except Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s very old and obliged friend Antônio José de Abreu S.C., April 21, 1840.\n\nI sent three patacões. (a) Almeida. Plus 2 patacões on the 28th. Plus 10 said on the 30th of the current month. Charged to the Hospital. Most Illustrious Most Excellent Sir Domingos José de Almeida. 1840 April 30."
