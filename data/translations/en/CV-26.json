  "translation": "Most Excellent Sir\n\nThere are people who, supposing they trouble you, do not do so as persistently as I do, because I am compelled by circumstances to bother you, not only out of my own respect but also for others, as is happening now, since the day before yesterday I requested funds for the hospital and now I do so for myself; I am well certain of what you sent me to say, but necessity compels everything, and for that reason one patacão or two patacões is enough for someone who has not a vintém nor anyone to ask for it except Your Excellency, Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency's very old and obliged friend, Antônio José de Abreu S.C., April 21, 1840.\n\nI sent three patacões. (a) Almeida. Plus 2 patacões on the 28th. Plus 10 said on the 30th of the current month. Charged to the Hospital. Most Illustrious and Most Excellent Sir Domingos José de Almeida. April 30, 1840."
