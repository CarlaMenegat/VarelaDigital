  "translation": "There are people who, it seems, do not bother so continuously as I do, because I am compelled by circumstances to trouble you, not only out of my respect but for others as well, as it happens now that I asked for assistance for the hospital just the day before yesterday, and now I am doing so for myself; I am quite sure of what you told me to say, yet necessity obliges everything, and therefore a patacão or two patacões is enough for someone who has not a penny and no one to ask except for Your Excellency.\n\nS.C., April 21, 1840.\n\nI sent three patacões. (a) Almeida. More 2 patacões at 28. More 10 said at 30 of this month. Charged to the Hospital. Illustrious and Most Excellent Sir Domingos José de Almeida. April 30, 1840."
