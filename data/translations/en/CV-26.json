  "translation": "Most Excellent Sir\n\nThere are people who, supposing they bother you, do not do so as continuously as I do, because I am obliged by circumstances to importune you, not only out of my respect but also for others, as now happens, that having before yesterday asked for funds for the hospital, now I ask for myself; I am quite certain of what you told me to say, yet necessity compels everything, and therefore one patacão or two patacões is all that suffices for one who has not a vintém nor anyone to ask for it except Your Excellency. Your Excellency\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s very old and obliged friend Antônio José de Abreu S.C., April 21, 1840.\n\nI sent three patacões. (a) Almeida. Plus 2 patacões on the 28th. Plus 10 said on the 30th of this month. Charged to the Hospital. Most Illustrious Most Excellent Sir Domingos José de Almeida. 1840 April 30."
