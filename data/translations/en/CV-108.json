  "translation": "While the police commander of this district was on the mission of capturing some deserters from the 8th Corps of National Guards, he caught one from the 1st Line, whom I send to Your Excellency Francisco Fabiano da Silva on this date, and I do not mention the battalion to which he belongs because he does not know it or does not want to declare it. This is what I must convey, and I have the honor to present it to the esteemed knowledge of Your Excellency."
