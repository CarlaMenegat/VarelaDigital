  "translation": "Most Illustrious Excellency\n\nOn the night of Saturday, the 13th of the current month, according to the orders of Your Excellency, Itapuã set out with 140 cavalrymen and 100 infantrymen and 40 horses and sixteen head of cattle, all embarked on the steamer, with two barges and two war launches accompanying the Most Illustrious Excellency Senhor Sebastião do Rego Barros, Minister and Secretary of State for War Affairs; from which, outside of Itapuã, aboard the same steam barge, at 11 o'clock at night, I received the latest orders during his transfer from the steamer to the brig “Andorinha,” which was proceeding to Rio Grande; and at that very hour, I proceeded with the expedition to the Camaquã undertaking in order to defeat that rebel navy; however, the inconstancy of weather and seas caused the barges and launches to take on some water, which made me land on Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning at the point of the island of the Tapes, where disembarking and watering the horses and careening for the expedition, and after the vessels were refitted, I had everything re-embarked and proceeded at two in the afternoon to the designated point; and arriving on Tuesday at one o'clock in the morning between the two bars of Velhaco and Graxim, I disembarked the cavalry and from it dispatched two parties, pretending to be rebels, in various directions to gather horses, and I set out with another, also on the same mission; and directing myself to a deserted house of the family of Eleutério José Pereira, also a member of the rebel government; which being surrounded, I found there a sailor from the rebel launches who had come with permission, and being this man known to me as he had been my footman, he informed me of the state of affairs, that everything was as per my plan; the three parties, gathered with more than ten good horses, I had all the cavalry turn around, and from these, 20 with infantry weapons, leaving the said house surrounded by a party of five men so that no one could leave the house or, if anyone came, be captured; and I proceeded with the cavalry and the said man from the launch who was to guide me walking along the coast of the Brejo more than eight leagues, by Dona Antônia do Brejo, who immediately ordered, on the same night, to warn the commander of the farrapa navy Guarivalde Garibaldi, who was at night on alert with all his men, who would be facing more than fifty rebel carcananos and others of various classes, of whom, on Wednesday at 7 o'clock in the morning, he dispersed from alert, barring the infantry weapons inside a new house they had built at the foot of the beach, made of brick and lime with double walls, and a heavily reinforced roof, for the storage of cartridges and war equipment, having only two narrow doors, one facing the beach and the other inland; and just at the moment they were dispersed, attacked by the forces under my command, I was able to cut down more than twenty toward the beach side, of whom 14 perished, and others, wounded, threw themselves into the river, and more than thirty reached the famous house, and with bayonets lodged in the doors, blocked the entrance firing vehemently through the doors, and mainly on the beach where the launches were present; in view of this, it was necessary for me to find a way to make them surrender, posting the men in such a manner that there was no greater danger; and over the course of nearly three hours I waged active war on them not only with firearms, but twice I ordered bundles of firewood, kindling and tallow to be thrown onto the roof, which, burning fiercely, it was not possible due to the very thick reinforcement to break the tiles and cause fire on the rafters that would force them to vacate the house; and when they saw themselves in this strait they gave cheers for legality from inside, and I shouted to them to surrender and I would spare their lives, but their unworthy commander, influenced by brandy and blows, turned their opinion around by giving cheers for the republic, saying they would die but not surrender. In sight of Itapuã where we arrived on Friday night, and to this city on the 20th, early Saturday morning; I collected from the rebels in Camaquã, at the commander's house, their pirate ranks, documents, and details of Your Excellency Most Excellency\n\nMay God guard Your Excellency Porto Alegre, April 20, 1839.  \nNota Bene Most Illustrious Excellency Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito  \nPresident of the Province and Commander of the Arms of the Province of Rio Grande do Sul  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nHe fought on the 17th, being wounded."
