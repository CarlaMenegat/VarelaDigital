  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nOn the night of Saturday, the 13th of the current month, according to the orders of Your Excellency, Itapuã, with 140 cavalrymen and 100 infantrymen and 40 horses and sixteen head of cattle, all embarked on the steamer, two boats and two war launches accompanying the Most Illustrious and Excellent Lord Sebastião do Rego Barros, Minister and Secretary of State for War Affairs; from which, outside of Itapuã, aboard the same steamer, at 11 o’clock at night, I received the last orders, during his passage from the steamer to the brig “Andorinha” which was heading to Rio Grande; and at those same hours I proceeded with the expedition to the Camaquã enterprise with the aim of defeating that navy of rebels; however, the inconstancy of weather and seas caused the boats and launches to take on some water, which made me land on Monday, at 8 o’clock in the morning, at the point of the island of Tapes, where, disembarking and giving pasture to the horses and careening for the expedition, and after exhausting the vessels, I re-embarked everything and continued at two o’clock in the afternoon to the designated point; and arriving on Tuesday at one o’clock at dawn between the two bars of Velhaco and Graxim, I disembarked the cavalry, and from it I sent out two detachments, feigning to be rebels, to various destinations to gather horses, and I left with another, also on the same mission; and steering towards a lonely house, belonging to the family of Eleutério José Pereira, also a member of the rebel government; which, being surrounded, I there found a sailor from the rebels’ launches who had come on leave, and being this my acquaintance for having been my servant, he informed me of the state of affairs, that everything was according to my plan; having gathered the three detachments with 10 or so good horses, I made the entire cavalry return, and from them, 20 with infantry weapons, leaving the said house surrounded by a detachment of five men, so that no one could leave that house or anyone who came would be captured; and I proceeded with the cavalry and the said man from the launch who was to guide me, to travel along the coast of the Brejo more than eight leagues, by Dona Antônia do Brejo, and she immediately ordered, that very night, to warn the commander of the farrapo navy Guarivalde Garibaldi who was on alert all night with all his men, for there were about fifty rebels of the Carcanano and other classes, whom on Wednesday at 7 o’clock in the morning, he dispersed from the alarm, stacking the infantry weapons inside a new house they had built at the foot of the beach, made of brick and lime and double walls, and with a very reinforced roof, for the storage of masses and war train, having only two narrow doors, one facing the beach and the other towards the land side; and it was at the very moment they dispersed that they were attacked by the forces under my command, I was able to cut off more than twenty of them towards the beach, of whom 14 perished, and others, even wounded, threw themselves into the river, and some thirty gained the famous house, and fixing bayonets at the doors, blocked the entrance firing briskly through the doors, particularly over the beach where the launches were; in view of this, it was necessary for me to devise a way to make them surrender, posting the men in a manner that there would be little greater danger; and for almost three hours I waged a lively war upon them not only with gunfire, but twice I ordered fires to be thrown consisting of bundles of wood, broom, and tallow over the roof, which, burning in violent fire, it was not possible, due to the very thick reinforcement, to break the tiles and catch fire to the lath and rafters which would have forced them to leave the house; and when they found themselves in this predicament, they shouted inside in favor of legality and I shouted at them to surrender and that I would spare their lives, but their unworthy commander, under the power of cachaça and blows, made them change their minds, immediately shouting for the republic, saying that they would die indeed, but not surrender. In view of Itapuã, where we arrived on Friday night, and this city on the 20th, early Saturday morning; I took from the rebels in Camaquã, at the commander’s house, their pirate commissions, documents, and details of Your Excellency.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nPorto Alegre, April 20, 1839.  \nNote Well Most Illustrious and Excellent Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito  \nPresident of the Province and Commander of the Arms of the Province of Rio Grande do Sul  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nFought on the 17th, being wounded."
