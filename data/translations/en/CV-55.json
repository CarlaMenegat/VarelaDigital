  "translation": "On the night of Saturday, the 13th of the current month, according to the orders from Your Excellency, Itapuã with 140 cavalrymen, 100 infantrymen, 40 horses, and sixteen head of cattle, all embarked on the steamer, with two boats and two war barges accompanying the Most Illustrious and Most Excellent Lord Sebastião do Rego Barros, Minister and Secretary of State for War Affairs; from which, outside Itapuã, aboard the same steamer, at 11 o'clock at night, I received the final orders during his transfer from the steamer to the brig \"Andorinha\" that was heading to Rio Grande; and at that same hour, I set off with the expedition to Camaquã to defeat that fleet of rebels; however, the inconsistency of weather and sea caused the boats and barges to take in some water, which led me to arrive at the tip of the island of Tapes on Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning, where, disembarking and feeding the horses and preparing for the expedition, and after the vessels were emptied, I made everything embark and set off at two o'clock in the afternoon to the appointed point; and upon arriving on Tuesday at one o'clock in the early morning between the two bars of Velhaco and Graxim, I disembarked the cavalry and sent out two detachments, pretending to be rebels, to different destinations to gather horses, while I went out with another, also on the same errand; and heading to a secluded house belonging to the family of Eleutério José Pereira, also a member of the rebel government; which, being surrounded, I found there a sailor from the rebel barges who had come with permission, and being this one known to me as he had been my hand, he informed me of the state of affairs, that everything was according to my plan; with the three detachments gathered with 10 and some good horses, I ordered all the cavalry to return, and among these, 20 with infantry arms, leaving the said house surrounded by a detachment of five men, so that no one could escape from that house or anyone who came would be captured; and I proceeded with the cavalry and the said sailor from the barge who was to guide us along the coast of the Brejo for more than eight leagues, by D. Antônia do Brejo, and she immediately sent word, even that night, to alert the rebel navy commander Guarivalde Garibaldi, who was on alert with all his men, that there were about fifty armed rebels of various classes, of whom on Wednesday, at 7 o'clock in the day, I dispersed from the alarm, firing the infantry weapons inside a new house they had built at the foot of the beach, of brick and lime with double walls, and with a heavily slanted roof, to store munitions and war supplies, only with two narrow doors, one to the beach and another to the land side; and at the same moment they dispersed, they were attacked by the forces under my command, I managed to cut off twenty or so on the beach side, of which 14 perished, and others, even wounded, threw themselves into the river, and more than thirty took refuge in the famous house, and blocking the door with bayonets, they defended the entrance, firing heavily from the doors, especially towards the beach where the barges were; in view of this, it was necessary for me to find a way to force them to surrender, positioning my men in such a way as to minimize danger; and for almost three hours I waged fierce war against them not only with gunfire but also twice I ordered the launching of bundles of firewood, brush, and tallow onto the roof, which burning with violent fire made it impossible for them to break the thick roofing and set fire to the rafters that would force them to vacate the house; and when they found themselves in this tight spot, they shouted from within for legality, and I shouted to them to surrender, promising to spare their lives, but their ignoble commander, under the influence of liquor and blows, turned them against me, leading them to shout for the republic, declaring they would die but not surrender. In sight of Itapuã, where we arrived on Friday night, and this city on the 20th, Saturday morning; I collected from the rebels in Camaquã, at the commander's house, their pirate commissions, documents, and details of Your Excellency."
