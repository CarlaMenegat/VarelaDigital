  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nOn the night of Saturday, the 13th of the current month, in accordance with Your Excellency's orders, Itapuã, with 140 cavalrymen and 100 infantrymen, and 40 horses and sixteen head of cattle, all embarked on the steamer, with two boats and two war barges accompanying the Most Illustrious and Excellent Senhor Sebastião do Rego Barros, Minister and Secretary of State for War Affairs; from which, upon leaving Itapuã, aboard the same steam barque, at 11 o'clock at night, I received the latest orders, during his transfer from the steamer to the brig “Andorinha” which was heading to Rio Grande; and at those very hours I proceeded with the expedition to the mission at Camaquã with the aim of defeating that rebel navy; however, the changeable weather and seas caused the boats and barges to take on some water, which caused me to arrive on Monday, at 8 o'clock in the morning, at the tip of the island of the Tapes, where disembarking, grazing the horses and careening for the expedition, and with the vessels exhausted, I re-embarked everything and continued at two o'clock in the afternoon to the designated point; and arriving on Tuesday at one o'clock in the morning between the two bars of Velhaco and Graxim, I disembarked the cavalry, and from it I sent out two detachments, pretending to be rebels, to various destinations to gather horses, and I went out with another, also on the same task; and heading toward a deserted house belonging to the family of Eleutério José Pereira, also a member of the rebel government; which being surrounded, there I found a sailor from the rebel barges who had come with permission, and being known to me as he had been my servant, he informed me of the state of affairs, which were all according to my plan; gathering the three detachments with ten or so good horses, I made all the cavalry return, and of these, 20 with infantry arms, and leaving the said house surrounded by a detachment of five men so that no one could leave that house nor anyone who attempted would not be captured; and I proceeded with the cavalry and the said man from the barge who was to guide me to travel along the coast of the Brejo for more than eight leagues, through D. Antônia do Brejo, who immediately ordered, that very night, to notify the commander of the farrapa navy Guarivalde Garibaldi, who was on alert that night with all his men, that there would be about fifty rebels of carcananos and other classes, of whom on Wednesday, at 7 o'clock in the morning, he dispersed the alarm, storing the infantry weapons inside a new house they had built at the foot of the beach, of brick and lime and double walls, and with a very steep roof, for the storage of ammo and war equipment, with only two narrow doors, one towards the beach and the other on the land side; and being at the very moment they dispersed attacked by the forces of my command, I was able to cut off around twenty towards the beach, of whom 14 perished, and others, even wounded, threw themselves into the river, and about thirty reached the famous house, and planting their bayonets in the doors, blocked the entrance, making a lively fire through the doors, chiefly towards the beach where the barges were; in view of this I was forced to devise a way to make them surrender, positioning the men in such a way as to avoid a greater danger; and over nearly three hours I waged lively warfare on them not only with firearms, but twice I ordered bundles of firewood, brushwood and tallow to be thrown onto the roof, which burning fiercely made it impossible, due to the very thick steepness, to break the tiles and ignite the battens and rafters, which would have forced them to leave the house; and when they found themselves in this plight they gave shouts inside for legality and I shouted to them to surrender and that I would spare their lives, but the unworthy commander of theirs, under the influence of cachaça and blows, made them change their minds, immediately shouting viva to the republic saying yes to dying, no to surrender.\n\nIn sight of Itapuã where we arrived on Friday night, and to this city on the 20th, early Saturday; I collected from the rebels in Camaquã, at the commander's house, their badges of pirates, documents, and details of Your Excellency Most Illustrious and Excellent\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency Porto Alegre, April 20, 1839. Nota Bene Most Illustrious and Excellent Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito President of the Province and Commander of the Arms of the Province of Rio Grande do Sul Francisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nFought on the 17th, being wounded."
