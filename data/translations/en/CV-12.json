  "translation": "Friend and Lord São Lourenço February 9, 1842\n\nThe bearer of this is Senhor João Agostinho da Silva, owner of the samples of saragoças and cloths that I have left with you, and who intends to enter into business with the government, for which purpose he is going there in order to better make his contract, and for any business he may conduct I hereby hold myself responsible as if it were my own; therefore I beg you to protect him in whatever you can, for I shall regard any favor done to him as done to myself, since he is a person of my friendship and to whom I wish to be of service.\n\nHaving obtained my just claim, and that the Excellent Senhor Fontoura has fulfilled what he promised me, I beg you to send me through the same Senhor Jaguarão, as also that of the poor Alexandre Silveira.\n\nYour sincere and obliged friend Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu\n\nAnswered on February 23, 1842.\n\nAnnex 1 to document CV-11."
