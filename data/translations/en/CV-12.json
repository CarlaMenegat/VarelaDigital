  "translation": "The bearer of this letter is Senhor João Agostinho da Silva, owner of the samples of saragoças and cloths that I left with you, and he intends to engage in business with the government, for which purpose he is heading there to better formalize his contract. For any business he undertakes, I take responsibility for it as if it were my own, therefore I kindly ask you to protect him in any way you can, as I will consider any kindness shown to him as done to myself, for he is a person of my friendship and to whom I wish to extend my support.\n\nGiven that I have achieved my rightful claim, and that the Most Excellent Fontoura has fulfilled what he told me, I kindly request that you send me through Senhor Jaguarão, also that of poor Alexandre Silveira."
