  "translation": "Friend and Lord Saint Lawrence, February 9, 1842\n\nThe bearer of this is Mr. João Agostinho da Silva, owner of the samples of zaragozas and cloths that I left with you, and who intends to engage in business with the government, for which purpose he is there to better carry out his contract, and for any business he undertakes I take responsibility by this letter as if it were my own, therefore I beg you to protect him in whatever you can, as I will consider any kindness shown to him as shown to myself, for he is a person of my friendship and whom I wish to oblige.\n\nIf he has succeeded in my rightful claim, and if the Most Excellent Fontoura has fulfilled what he promised me, I beg you to send me by the same Mr. Jaguarão, as well as that of poor Alexandre Silveira.\n\nYour sincere and obliged friend Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu\n\nAnswered on February 23, 1842.\n\nAnnex 1 to document CV-11."
