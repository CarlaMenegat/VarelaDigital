  "translation": "Friend and Lord São Lourenço February 9, 1842\n\nThe bearer of this is Senhor João Agostinho da Silva, owner of the samples of zaragozas and cloths that I left with you, and who intends to enter into business with the government, for which purpose he is going there to better conduct his contract, and for any business he may do I hereby take responsibility as if it were my own; therefore, I beg you to protect him in whatever you can, as I will consider any kindness shown to him as shown to myself, for he is a person of my friendship and whom I wish to serve.\n\nIf he has succeeded in my just claim, and if the Excellent Fontoura has fulfilled what he told me, I beg you to send me by the same Senhor Jaguarão, also that of poor Alexandre Silveira.\n\nYour sincere and grateful friend Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu\n\nAnswered on February 23, 1842.\n\nAnnex 1 to document CV-11."
