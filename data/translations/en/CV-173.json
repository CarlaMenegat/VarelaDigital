  "translation": "My dear old one of the heart. Porto Alegre, May 30, 1835.\n\nToday I wrote to you through Manuel Barcelos and send this by mail so as not to deprive you of news from me.\n\nHere I live almost shut in, because in the morning I go to the Assembly, and I barely return if the house fills with farroupilhas, who almost always leave me at midnight; for that reason I have not yet toured the whole city, nor have I gone to Viamão although uncle Francisco came to visit me with the whole family and Ângelo. But since I have to stay until the holy days for the appointment of the vice-president, I intend to visit them then and proceed to the colony of São Francisco de Paula, to finally see that settlement, and be ready to return as soon as the said appointment is concluded. The charqueador Leão, where the French of the grease live, sent to invite me to go there and prepare great things to honor me; but I have been so indifferent that I might not accept this favor.\n\nRegards to your father, mother, brothers, José Felix, his son, and warm embraces to each of our children, whose absence, like yours, has been so deeply felt by me. Your old one of the heart Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. São Francisco de Paula. Pelotas."
