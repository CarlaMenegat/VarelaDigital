  "translation": "Today I wrote to you through Manuel Barcelos and I am sending this by mail so as not to deprive you of news from me.\n\nHere I live as if enclosed, because in the morning I go to the Assembly, and I only return if the house fills with farroupilhas, who almost always leave me at midnight; for this reason, I have not yet traversed the entire city, nor have I been to Viamão despite Uncle Francisco coming to visit me with the whole family and Ângelo. But since I have to stay until the holy days for the appointment of the vice-president, I intend to visit them then and proceed to the colony of São Francisco de Paula, to see that settlement at once and be ready to return as soon as said appointment is finalized. Charqueador Leão, where the French of the grease live, invited me to go there and is preparing great things to entertain me; but I am so indifferent that perhaps I will not accept this favor."
