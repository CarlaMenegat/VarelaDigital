  "translation": "My dear old one of the heart. Porto Alegre, May 30, 1835.\n\nToday I wrote to you through Manuel Barcelos and send this by mail so as not to deprive you of news from me.\n\nHere I live as if enclosed, because in the morning I go to the Assembly, and I barely return if the house is filled with Farroupilhas, who almost always leave me around midnight; therefore I have not yet explored the whole city, nor have I been to Viamão despite uncle Francisco having come to visit me with all the family and Ângelo. But since I must stay until the Holy Days for the appointment of the vice-president, I intend during that time to visit them and then go on to the colony of São Francisco de Paula, to see that settlement once and for all, and be ready to return as soon as the said appointment is finalized. The charqueador Leão, where the Frenchmen of the grease live, sent to invite me to go there and prepare great things to honor me; but I have been so indifferent that I may not accept this favor.\n\nRegards to your father, mother, siblings, José Felix, his son, and tight embraces to each of our children, whose absence, like yours, has been so painful to me. Your old one of the heart, Almeida.\n\nMadam Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. São Francisco de Paula. Pelotas."
