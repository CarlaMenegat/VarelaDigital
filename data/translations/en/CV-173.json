  "translation": "My dear old one of the heart. Porto Alegre, May 30, 1835.\n\nToday I wrote to you by Manuel Barcelos and I send this by mail so as not to deprive you of news from me.\n\nHere I live as if confined, because in the morning I go to the Assembly, and I barely return if the house is filled with farroupilhas, who almost always leave me around midnight; for this reason, I have not yet toured the whole city, I have not yet been to Viamão although uncle Francisco came to visit me with his whole family and Ângelo. But since I have to stay until the holy days for the appointment of the vice-president, I intend to visit them then and go to the colony of São Francisco de Paula, to see that settlement once and for all, and be ready to return as soon as the said appointment is finalized. The charqueador Leão, where the French of the grease live, sent me an invitation to go there and prepares great things to honor me; but I have been so indifferent that I might not accept this favor.\n\nRegards to your father, mother, brothers, José Felix, his son, and tight embraces to each of our children, whose absence, like yours, has been so painful to me. Your old one of the heart Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. São Francisco de Paula. Pelotas."
