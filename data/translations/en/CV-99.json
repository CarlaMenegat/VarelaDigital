  "translation": "Rio Grande, October 30, 1849.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nI have been insistent in demanding the three hundred and thirty-two and a half pesos which, through the intercession and responsibility of Your Lordship Sir Manuel Severino Xavier, at the Treasury of Taquarembó, because, as I have already told Your Lordship Sir Palácios, when he delivered the commitment document to the same Sir Xavier last year, he drew on me for that amount and I have not been able to satisfy it; this failure leaves, as Your Lordship Sir Palácios and mine: that of that Sir Taquarembó to be delivered here counting that the payment would already have been made, and mine, for being the cause of that unpleasant shortage.\n\nIf it were not for this circumstance I would not have spoken of this matter for a long time; I would wait for the true debtor to place in the hands of Your Lordship Sir Palácios, to whom the person who was supposed to receive the money here has made accusations, I am unable to refrain from informing you of the cause of not having fulfilled your order, especially since the same Sir Vasco Madruga assured Sir Palácios that he had delivered the three hundred and thirty-two and a half pesos to the same charqueador to whom Manuel Severino Xavier sold the troop.\n\nLeaving with this explanation a satisfied response to your esteemed letter of the 19th of the present month, I remain\n\nAt Your Excellence’s service, Atanásio C. Aguirre\n\nReceived November 4, 1849.\n\nRio Grande, October 30, 1849. From Sir Atanásio Aguirre.\n\nReceived November 4, 1849. Answered November 22, 1849."
