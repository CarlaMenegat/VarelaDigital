  "translation": "Rio Grande, October 30, 1849.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Domingos José de Almeida,\n\nI have been persistent in demanding the three hundred thirty-two and a half pesos that, through the intermediation and responsibility of Your Lordship, Sir Manuel Severino Xavier, at the Taquarembó Treasury, because, as I have already told Your Lordship, Sir Palácios, when he delivered the commitment document to the same Mr. Xavier last year, he drew on me for that amount and I have not been able to satisfy him; this failure leaves, as Your Lordship, Sir Palácios, and myself: that of the gentleman from Taquarembó to be delivered here, counting that the payment would already have been made, and mine, for being the cause of that unpleasant default.\n\nIf it were not for this circumstance, I would not have spoken of this matter for a long time; I would have waited for the real debtor to place in the hands of Your Lordship, Sir Palácios, to whom the person who was supposed to receive the money here has made charges, I am unable to avoid informing you of the reason for not having fulfilled your order, especially as the same Mr. Vasco Madruga assured Mr. Palácios that he had handed over the three hundred thirty-two and a half pesos to the very charqueador (jerky seller) to whom Manuel Severino Xavier sold the cattle.\n\nLeaving this explanation, I am satisfied with the reply to your esteemed letter of the 19th of this month, I remain\n\nAt the disposal of Your Excellency,\n\nAtanásio C. Aguirre\n\nReceived on November 4, 1849.\n\nRio Grande, October 30, 1849. From Mr. Atanásio Aguirre.\n\nReceived on November 4, 1849. Answered on November 22, 1849."
