  "translation": "I have been bothersome in demanding the three hundred thirty-two and a half pesos that are due by the interposition and responsibility of Your Honor, Mr. Manuel Severino Xavier, at the Revenue Office of Taquarembó, because, as I have already mentioned to Your Honor, Mr. Palácios, when he delivered the commitment document to Mr. Xavier last year, he withdrew the amount from me, and I have not been able to satisfy him; this shortcoming leaves, as Your Honor, Mr. Palácios, and mine: that of Mr. Taquarembó to be delivered here, assuming that the payment had already been made, and mine, being the cause of that unpleasant shortfall.\n\nIf it were not for this circumstance, I would not have spoken for a long time about this matter; I would have waited for the true debtor to place into the hands of Your Honor, Mr. Palácios, to whom the individual who was to receive the money here has made demands. I am unable to refrain from informing you of the reason for not having fulfilled your order, especially since Mr. Vasco Madruga assured Mr. Palácios that he had delivered the three hundred thirty-two and a half pesos to the same beef provider to whom Manuel Severino Xavier sold the herd.\n\nHaving satisfied with this explanation the response to your esteemed letter of the 19th of this month, I remain,\n\nReceived on November 4, 1849.\n\nResponded on November 22, 1849."
