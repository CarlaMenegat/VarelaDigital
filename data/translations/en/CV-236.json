  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, March 26, 1838.\n\nAlready almost night I received yours of the 24th of this month, by virtue of which I send you a purgative for Epaminondas; and cousin Mateus says to use the gargles that followed yesterday by the Cadet, as well as those of mallow with milk and refreshments.\n\nBento left five days ago, and he is now just returning; tomorrow I intend still to clothe myself in prudence to speak about the closing of my accounts, and if I do not, perhaps I will lose control. Let the Catraio return soon bringing me the dapple gray and coming on the little donkey, since the piebald became ill.\n\nRecommend me to your parents, to Bernardino, to all the others; embrace our children for me and you receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nAfter this event José arrived; and since the gargles were by the Cadet, I send him back already with two purgatives for Epaminondas. If he dies he cannot go at a better age: at least he spares himself from suffering what his father has suffered. If that happens, let him be buried even in some cemetery of these surroundings, to later transfer his bones when circumstances allow, just as I intend to do with those of our dear Mingote. Clothe yourself with constancy, for heaven wills it so. Almeida\n\nMadam. Happy Retreat."
