  "translation": "It was almost night when I received your letter of the 24th of this month, for which I am sending you a purgative for Epaminondas; and cousin Mateus says to use the mouthfuls that followed yesterday through Cadete, just as those of marshmallows with milk and refreshments.\n\nBento left 5 days ago, and he is just now returning; tomorrow I intend to still equip myself with prudence to discuss the finalization of my accounts, and if I do not manage that, perhaps I will lose my composure. The Catraio should return soon bringing me the roan and coming on the little donkey, as the peacock has fallen ill."
