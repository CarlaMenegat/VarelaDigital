  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, March 26, 1838.\n\nAlready almost night I received yours of the 24th of this month, by virtue of which I send you a purgative for Epaminondas; and cousin Mateus says to use the gargles that followed yesterday by the Cadet, such as those of mallow with milk and refreshments.\n\nBento left five days ago, and just now he is returning; tomorrow I intend still to clothe myself with prudence to speak of the closing of my accounts, and if they do not do so, perhaps I will lose the reins. Let the Catraio return soon bringing me the gray horse and coming on the little donkey, for the picaço fell ill.\n\nCommend me to your parents, to Bernardino, to all the others; embrace our children for me and receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nAfter this, José arrived; and since the gargles went by the Cadet, I make him return at once with two purgatives for Epaminondas. If he dies he could not go at a better age: at least he avoids suffering what his father has suffered. If this happens, let him be buried even in some cemetery of these surroundings, to later transfer his bones when circumstances allow, just as I intend to do with those of our dear Mingote. Clothe yourself with firmness, for Heaven so wills it. Almeida\n\nMadam. Happy Retreat."
