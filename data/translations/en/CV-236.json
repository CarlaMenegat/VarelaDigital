  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, March 26, 1838.\n\nAlready almost night I received yours of the 24th of this month, by virtue of which I send you a purgative for Epaminondas; and cousin Mateus says to use the mouth rinses that yesterday followed by the Cadet, as well as those of mallows with milk and refreshments.\n\nBento left 5 days ago, and now he is just returning; tomorrow I still intend to clothe myself with prudence to speak about the finalization of my accounts, and if I do not do so, perhaps I will lose control. The Catraio should return soon bringing me the gray horse and coming on the little donkey, for the pinto horse fell ill.\n\nRecommend me to your parents, to Bernardino, to all the others; embrace our children for me and you receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nAfter this was done José arrived; and since the mouth rinses were sent by the Cadet, I have him return already with two purgatives for Epaminondas. If he dies he could not go at a better age: at least he avoids suffering what his father has suffered. If this occurs, let him be buried even in some cemetery of these surroundings, so that later his bones can be transferred when circumstances permit, just as I intend to do with those of our dear Mingote. Clothe yourself in constancy, for heaven so wills it. Almeida\n\nMadam. Happy Retirement."
