  "translation": "By virtue of your office of the 4th of this month, which I received last night, I send to Your Excellency São Gabriel. On this occasion, I ask Your Excellency Joaquim de Faria Correia or Major Manuel Pires to take charge of the invoice and shipment of the beef cattle that are to leave that district for Montevideo, stemming from the loan I promoted and the gratuitous gift that several citizens have voluntarily offered for the expenses of the current struggle for our independence; for which I direct the attached letters that Your Excellency."
