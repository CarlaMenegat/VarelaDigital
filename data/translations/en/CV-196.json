  "translation": "I let Casaca come to write to you from here, but I have decided to take him.\n\nSend me through Vicente 2 pieces of yellow cloth. Regards to all our loved ones and hugs to our children. Rest assured that I am not going to Rio, and that soon I will proceed to the Assembly; goodbye, see you soon.\n\nThe slaves from that list I sent you from Porto Alegre, send them there to be ready."
