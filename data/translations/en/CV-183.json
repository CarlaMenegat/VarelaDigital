  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart  \nPorto Alegre, December 15, 1835.\n\nI have already received two of yours, and from the delight that both have caused me, you can judge by the feelings you experience when you receive mine. I had been quite distressed until a few days ago, thinking that well-directed intrigues had caused distrust among ours; however, seeing the contrary, that we are firmly moving forward in the good of our Province, joy has been reborn in my heart. I now live content, and the young ladies do not leave me troubled; poor things, they waste their time, because I pay no heed to them and consequently, all say there is no girl more fortunate than you, that I am the example of married men, and with that I make the state desirable. And how about that? See how much my behavior is worth and how happy you are possessing a husband who is young, handsome, well-made, and faithful. Where does one find so much combined? Indeed, in this century it is a phenomenon, a marvel, etc., etc.\n\nHugs to our children, regards to all our people, and farewell until the 23rd of this month, God willing; save me something.  \nYour husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nTo Mrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida.  \nPelotas."
