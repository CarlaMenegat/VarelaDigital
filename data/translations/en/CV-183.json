  "translation": "I have already received two of yours, and you can judge the contentment that both produced in me by the feelings you have when you receive mine. I had been quite distressed until a few days ago thinking that well-directed intrigues had sown doubts among our people; however, seeing on the contrary that we are moving steadily towards the good of our Province, pleasure has been reborn in my heart. I now live happily, and the girls do not let me be with their sorrows; poor things, they waste their time, because I do not pay attention to them and, consequently, they all say there is no girl more fortunate than you, that I am the example of the married, and I make it so that the state is desired. And how about that? Just see how valuable my behavior is and how happy you are to possess a young, handsome, well-made, and faithful husband. Where else can so much be found together? Indeed, in this century it is a phenomenon, it is a wonder, etc., etc."
