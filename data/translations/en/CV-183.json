  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart  \nPorto Alegre, December 15, 1835.\n\nI have already received two of yours, and from the contentment they both produced in me, you can judge by the sensations you feel upon receiving mine. I had been very distressed until just a few days ago, thinking that well-directed intrigues had produced distrust among ours; however, seeing the opposite, that we are firmly progressing in the good of our Province, pleasure has been revived in my heart. Now I live contentedly, and the girls do not leave me with distress; poor things, who waste their time, for I pay no attention to them and, consequently, all say that there is no girl more fortunate than you, that I am the example of the married, and by this I make the state desirable. And what do you say? See how much my behavior is worth and how happy you are possessing a husband who is young, handsome, well-made, and faithful. Where does one find so many things together? Indeed, in this century it is a phenomenon, a marvel, etc., etc.\n\nHugs to our children, regards to all our kin, and farewell until the 23rd of this month, God willing; keep something for me.  \nYour husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nTo Mrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
