  "translation": "—Yesterday we received a letter from Doctor Sebastião Ribeiro, written from the other side of Ibicuí, in which he said, “we arrived today, the 18th, in Bororé and today Loureiro set up camp at Santinho and we, at night, set out in pursuit of him\"; today I received, I mean, just now, at about 10 o'clock in the day, a notice from Major Carneiro who had set out with 40 men to scout along the coast of Ibicuí to see if they find a hundred men on this side of Ibicuí, at the Ibirocaí bar, these being enemies; and at this very moment I ordered everything that could be armed to gather to march with me tomorrow, as well as I ordered Captain Manuel Álvares to move up to join at the ends of Ibirocaí, where Major Carneiro is, to see if Captain Fortunato is in Santa Ana with the garrison; and since there is much talk of Medeiros around here, on that side do not neglect to affirm and let me know, as well as requisition anything that is lacking in any garrison that may be there in our favor, and for those against us, command them to receive blows and beatings. If compadre Guedes is around or any force, even if they are about to march, make them delay because we may need them if the enemy sways that way which is likely; in light of the troubles, I have cleared this town of everything that could be armed, and for the past 8 days here Serra de Botucaraí has been harassing the rear of Sebastião Barreto; he sent word to me that the 500 and so men of Loureiro did not trouble the 250 he had;"
