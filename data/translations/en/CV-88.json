  "translation": "Most Illustrious,\n\n— Yesterday we received a letter from Doctor Sebastião Ribeiro, written from the other side of Ibicuí, in which he said, “We arrived today, the 18th, at Bororé, and today itself Loureiro raised camp from Santinho down Ibicuí, and we, at night, set out in pursuit of him”; today I received, I say, just now, it must be 10 o’clock of the day, a notice from Major Carneiro that he had set out with 40 men to observe along the coast of Ibicuí to see if they would find a hundred men on this side of Ibicuí, at the mouth of Ibirocaí, these being enemies; and at this very moment I ordered to gather everything that could bear arms to march with me tomorrow, likewise I ordered Captain Manuel Álvares to proceed upriver to join at the points of Ibirocaí, where Major Carneiro is, to see if Captain Fortunato is at Santa Ana with the garrison; and since there is much talk of Medeiros around here, on this side do not fail to ascertain and send me word, as well as requisition anything that may be lacking at any garrison that may be in our favor around there, and those who are against us, order them to be beaten and whipped. If godfather Guedes is around or any force, even if they are about to march, make them delay because we may need them if the enemy leans toward that side which is inclined; in view of the troubles, I have swept through this village everything that can bear arms, and for 8 days past, here at Serra de Botucaraí harassing the rear of Sebastião Barreto; he sent me word that the 500-some men of Loureiro did not please the 250 he was leading;\n\nand I am your obliged and devoted friend, (a) José Inácio da Silva Abreu."
