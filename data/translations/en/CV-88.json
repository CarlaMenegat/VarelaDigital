  "translation": "Most Illustrious\n\n—Yesterday we received a letter from Doctor Sebastião Ribeiro, written from the other side of Ibicuí, in which he said: “We arrived today, the 18th, in Bororé, and today Loureiro lifted camp from Santinho down Ibicuí, and we, at night, will set off in pursuit of him”; today I received, I say, just now, it must be 10 o’clock, a notice from Major Carneiro who had left with 40 men to scout along the coast of Ibicuí to see if there were a hundred men on this side of Ibicuí, mouth of Ibirocaí, these, enemies; and at this very moment I ordered to gather everything that could bear arms to march with me tomorrow, just as I also ordered Captain Manuel Álvares to go up and junction from the tips of Ibirocaí, where Major Carneiro is, to see if Captain Fortunato is in Santa Ana with the garrison; and since there is much talk of Medeiros around here, on this side do not fail to ascertain and send me word, as well as requisition anything that any garrison there on our side may lack, and those who are against us order to be beaten and whipped. If comrade Guedes is around or some force, even if they are about to march, make them delay because we may need them if the enemy tends towards that side, which is likely; faced with difficulties, I have swept from this village everything that can bear arms, and for the past eight days here in the Serra de Botucaraí harassing the rear of Sebastião Barreto; he sent me word that the 500-some men of Loureiro did not give pleasure to the 250 that he brought;\n\nand I am your obliged friend and servant. (a) José Inácio da Silva Abreu."
