  "translation": "Illustrious\n\n—Yesterday we received a letter from Doctor Sebastião Ribeiro, written from the other side of Ibicuí, in which he said, “we arrived today, the 18th, in Bororé and today itself Loureiro broke camp from Santinho down along Ibicuí and we, at night, started marching following him\"; today I received, I say, just now, it must be 10 o’clock of the day, a notice from Major Carneiro who had gone out with 40 men to observe along the coast of Ibicuí whether they would find a hundred men on this side of Ibicuí, at the mouth of Ibirocaí, these enemies; and at this very moment I ordered to gather all that could bear arms to march with me tomorrow, as well as I ordered Captain Manuel Álvares to go up and make a junction at the mouth of Ibirocaí, where Major Carneiro is, to see if Captain Fortunato is in Santa Ana with the garrison; and since it is a matter involving Medeiros around here, on this side do not fail to affirm and send word to me, as well as requisition anything lacking to any garrison that is in our favor there, and those who are against us, order to give them sticks and lashes. If comrade Guedes is around or any force, even if they are about to march, make them delay because we might need them if the enemy tends toward that side which is inclined; given the difficulties, I have swept from this town all that can bear arms, and for 8 days now here at Serra de Botucaraí poking at the rear of Sebastião Barreto; he sent me word that the 500 and some men of Loureiro did not make joyful the 250 he took;\n\nand I am your obliged friend and servant. (a) José Inácio da Silva Abreu."
