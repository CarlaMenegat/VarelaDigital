  "translation": "Lúcio Antônio de Santa Ana, soldier of the 3rd Hunters Battalion, who fell ill at the estate of Padre Feliciano when this battalion was marching to join the forces coming from Rio Grande, was captured on the 25th of last November, when the rebel force led by Agostinho was defeated; and as I was informed of these circumstances, I took him out of the group of prisoners to hand him over to the battalion; and now I present him to Your Excellency."
