  "translation": "Dear Bernardina of my heart. Pelotas, March 14, 1836.\n\nAfter bitter afflictions, cares, and fears, I received the precious letters of yours from the 23rd of last month the day before yesterday, and you can judge my satisfaction. Yes, taught by the experience of the brutal and fierce nature of these people, who formerly followed the party of Braga and now do what Araújo Ribeiro defends, I could not bear my existence when I considered you and our children in the power of this infernal horde; but fortune willed that I be mistaken, and that your letters and those of someone from there informed me otherwise: for, thanks to Heaven, you live and our children, for now, without other trouble than that attached to the critical circumstances we are going through. I have already told you that I was appointed by the Assembly to which I belong to go to Rio de Janeiro to inform the Government of Brazil of our political state and what we need for the tranquillity of the Province and the integrity of the Empire. This choice could not be worse, I am the first to recognize it, nor would it be so painful for anyone as for me: however, the good of the Province obliges me, without murmuring, to obey an order which, for more than one reason, is sacred to me. I know that wife and children, and the unhappy state of our house, should exempt me from this commission; but the obligation to cooperate with all my strength for the good of the Province, and particularly for you and these same children, has forced me to an enterprise full of thorns and difficulties: if some unforeseen misfortune does not steal me forever from my family, which I do not expect, the example of serving the Homeland that I leave to our children is the brightest legacy I can give them: and this sole remembrance consoles me when I consider our separation, etc., etc....\n\nI am ready to leave and will do so immediately upon receiving some papers I requested from Bento Gonçalves, which perhaps will come through Rio Pardo, considering the course this compatriot of ours has taken: nevertheless, he does not cease to write (under cover) to José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim, to whom I shall entrust to send them to me in case I have already departed. As soon as things improve there, or if they can come by land, send me the slaves listed in the attached list, to deliver to the same José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim; and if compadre Rolino is already at home, let him himself come in this convoy, so as not to cause any disturbance in the journey. Rio Grande, I think it would be prudent for you and the whole family to come, as I had already decided: but if they present another aspect, I suppose you must stay there until my return from Rio, which I intend to be as soon as possible, even for the reason of the company of your parents, at a time like this, so turbulent. In short, on the matter I shall still have to write, in view of what you will tell me after receiving what I have written to you from February 13 to today, etc., etc.... Compadre José Félix and friend Chastan, who should be consulted and heard on everything, as well as Chaves if possible, etc., etc....\n\nJoão da Cunha informs me of the uprising of the slaves, due to compadre Rolino and Vicente having left: tell João Grande to manage them, for truly it is not prudent to have them haughty in such circumstances; and your father should now and then look after this as his own matter, in order to prevent mishaps and damages. The owner of the yacht should also assist as much as he can, once the yacht is in port, as it should be, he does not need to go on outings at such a time, and must under no circumstances fail to sleep on board. The blacks should also not be idle; they should rebuild the fences of the paddocks and farms, weed them, finish the lagoon I began in the large paddock, leaving drainage ditches on the sides, so that it does not burst with a great weight of water, and compadre José Félix or the Senhor should show how to make such drainage ditches, both must remain at the same level so that the waters are not drained by one alone. When this is finished and still it is not possible to work in the pottery, they should make a third paddock on the land running from the end of what is done to the yard [...].\n\nAs compadre Cipriano has not written to me since he left here, I also do not write to him; give me news of him, of the great Mateus, of Cândido Fernandes Lima, of your cousin José Moreira, of the editor of the Liberal Domingues, of Goularte, and Espíndola of Rio Grande; as well as of everything else that may have happened there, worthy of being mentioned, etc., etc....\n\nCompadre and comadre, our parents, who regard this as their own, as well as compadres José Félix, Joaquim, João, Chaves, Chastan, Chevalier, and David. Hugs to our children, a kiss to Custódia, and you receive the heart of your Almeida.\n\nThe letters you write me may be sent to João Gonçalves da Silva, who will forward them to me; and when urgent, send by courier, since he does not live far away.\n\nLady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
