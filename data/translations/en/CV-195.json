  "translation": "Dear Bernardina of my heart. Pelotas, March 14, 1836.\n\nAfter bitter afflictions, cares and fears, I received the valuable letters of yours dated the 23rd of last month the day before yesterday, and you can judge my satisfaction. Yes, taught by the experience of the brutal and fierce nature of these people, who formerly followed the party of Braga and now do what Araújo Ribeiro defends, I could not endure my existence when I considered you and our children in the power of this infernal horde; but fortune willed that I was mistaken, and that your letters and those of this person instructed me otherwise: since, thanks to heaven, you live and our children, for now, without other inconvenience than that attached to the critical circumstances we are going through. I already told you that I was appointed by the Assembly to which I belong to go to Rio de Janeiro to inform the Government of Brazil of our political state and what we need for the peace of the Province and integrity of the Empire. This choice could not have been worse, I am the first to recognize it, nor could it be so painful to anyone else as it is to me: however, the good of the Province obliges me, without murmur, to obey an order for more than one reason sacred to me. I know that woman and children, and the unhappy state of our house, should exempt me from this commission; but the obligation to collaborate with all my strength for the good of the Province, and particularly for you and these same children, forced me into an enterprise full of thorns and difficulties: if some unforeseen misfortune does not take me away forever from my family, which I do not expect, the example of serving the Fatherland that I leave to our children is the most brilliant legacy I can give them: and this sole memory consoles me when I ponder our separation, etc., etc....\n\nI am ready to depart and will do so immediately upon receiving some papers I requested from Bento Gonçalves, which perhaps will come through Rio Pardo, given the course this compatriot of ours has taken: nevertheless, he does not cease writing to me (under cover) to José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim, whom I shall entrust to send them to me in case I have already left. As soon as matters improve there, or if I can come by land, send me the slaves listed in the attached roster, to deliver to the same José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim; and if compadre Rolino is already at home let him himself come in this convoy, so that there be no mishap during the journey. Rio Grande, I think it would be prudent that you and the whole family come, as I had already decided: but if things present another face, I suppose you should remain there until my return from Rio, which I intend to be as soon as possible, especially for the reason of the company of your parents, in such a tumultuous time as this. In short, on this subject I will still have to write, in light of what you will send me after you have received those I have written you from February 13 to today, etc., etc... Compadre José Félix and friend Chastan, who must be consulted and heard on all matters, as also Chaves if possible, etc., etc....\n\nJoão da Cunha notifies me of the agitation of the slaves, because compadre Rolino and Vicente have left: order João Grande to manage them, for truly it is imprudent to have them haughty in such a conjunction; and your father should look at this from time to time as if it were his own matter, so as to prevent mishaps and damages. The master of the yacht should also help as much as he can, once the yacht is in the port, as it must be, he does not need to take walks at such a time and on no account should he fail to sleep aboard. The blacks should not be idle either, let them rebuild the fences of the paddocks and farms, weed them, finish the lagoon I began in the large paddock, leaving spillways by the sides, so that it does not burst with a large mass of water, and compadre José Félix or the Lord should show how such spillways are made, both of them needing to remain at the same level to prevent the waters from needing more than one spillway. When this is concluded and it is still impossible to work in the pottery, let them make a third paddock on the land that runs from the end of the one already done to the yard [...].\n\nSince compadre Cipriano has not written to me since he left here, I also have not written to him; give me news of him, of big Mateus, of Cândido Fernandes Lima, of your cousin José Moreira, of the editor of the Liberal Domingues, of Goularte, and Espíndola of Rio Grande; as well as of everything else that may have happened there worthy of being remembered, etc., etc....\n\nCompadre and comadre, our parents, who take this as their own as also compadres José Félix, Joaquim, João, Chaves, Chastan, Chevalier and David. Hugs to our children, a kiss to Custódia, and you receive the heart of Yours, Almeida.\n\nThose that you write to me can be sent to João Gonçalves da Silva, who will forward them to me; and if in a hurry, send them by a private person, as he does not live far away.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
