  "translation": "After bitter afflictions, worries, and fears, I received the esteemed letter of the 23rd of last month the day before yesterday, and you can judge my satisfaction. Indeed, having been schooled by the experience of the brutal and fierce nature of these people, who once followed the party of Braga and today defend Araújo Ribeiro, I could hardly endure my existence when I considered you and our children at the mercy of this infernal horde; but fortune willed that I be deceived, and that your letters and those of a person from there informed me otherwise: for, thanks to heaven, you live, and our children, for now, without any other inconvenience than that linked to the critical circumstances we are going through. I have already told you that I was appointed by the Assembly to which I belong to go to Rio de Janeiro to inform the Government of Brazil of our political state and what we need for the tranquility of the Province and the integrity of the Empire. This choice could not have been worse, I am the first to recognize it, nor could it be more painful for anyone than for me: however, the good of the Province compels me, without complaint, to obey an order which for more than one reason is sacred to me. I know that my wife and children, and the unhappy state of our home, should shield me from this commission; but the obligation to contribute with all my strength for the good of the Province, and particularly for you and those same children, forced me into an undertaking full of thorns and difficulties: if some unforeseen disaster were to take me forever from my family, which I do not expect, the example of serving the Fatherland that I leave to our children is the brightest legacy I can give them: and this solitary thought comforts me when I ponder our separation, etc., etc....\n\nI am ready to follow and will do so immediately upon receiving some papers I requested from Bento Gonçalves, which may perhaps come to me via Rio Pardo, given the course our compatriot has taken: in the meantime, he does not cease to write to José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim, whom I will charge to send them to me in case I have departed. As soon as things improve there, or they can come by land, send me the slaves listed in the attached list, to be delivered to the same José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim; and if compadre Rolino is already at home, he should come along with that transport, in order to avoid any turmoil on the journey. Rio Grande, I think it would be wise for you and the whole family to come, as I had already decided; however, if these circumstances present another face, I suppose you should remain there until my return from Rio, which I intend to be as soon as possible, even for the sake of your parents' company at such an agitated time as this. In the end, I will still have to write about the subject, in light of what you direct to me after you receive what I have written to you from the 13th of February until today, etc., etc.... Compadre José Félix and friend Chastan should be consulted and heard on everything, as well as Chaves if he can be, etc., etc....\n\nJoão da Cunha informs me of the uprising of the slaves, due to the departure of compadre Rolino and Vicente: have João Grande manage them, for it is indeed not prudent to have them high-spirited in such circumstances; and your father should every now and then keep an eye on this as if it were his own business, in order to prevent discord and damages. The master of the yacht should also help in whatever he can, since with the yacht in the harbor, as it should be, he does not need to go for strolls at such a time, and by no means should he fail to sleep on board. The slaves who are not otherwise occupied should rebuild the dikes of the pastures and gardens, hoe them, and finish the lagoon I started in the large pasture, leaving drainage paths on the sides, so as not to be breached by heavy water, and compadre José Félix or the Lord should indicate how such drainage should be done, as both should remain at the same level so that the water does not flow to just one. Once this is completed and work cannot yet be done at the pottery, they should create a third pasture on the land that runs from the end of what is finished to the pathway [...].\n\nAs compadre Cipriano has not written to me since he left here, I do not write to him either; give me news of him, of the great Mateus, of Cândido Fernandes Lima, your cousin José Moreira, the editor of Liberal Domingues, Goularte, and Espíndola from Rio Grande; as well as of everything else that has happened there, worthy of being remembered, etc., etc...."
