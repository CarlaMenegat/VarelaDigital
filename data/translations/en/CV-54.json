  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn compliance with the orders of Your Excellency, I descended the Guaíba River, disembarking at ten o’clock at night at Ponta Rasa; having already dispatched a detachment of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant Isaías Antônio Alz. to Faxinal to escort the war gunboat that had fallen into the hands of the rebels, whose protection I was undertaking; but before that, during the night, I proceeded to Passo Fundo to attack a rebel force of over a hundred men commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tomás Pereira. However, as he had already withdrawn from that position, fearful, and I learned that he had sent a detachment of twenty-odd men to Passo do Pesqueiro to protect the passage and convoy of some carts belonging to Antônio de Sousa Neto, general-in-chief of the anarchist forces, immediately, that same night, I proceeded to that pass, both to protect the detachment I had sent to retrieve the war gunboat at Faxinal and to seize said carts; and indeed, before reaching Passo do Pesqueiro, at a distance of half a league, and before dawn, I found the said carts with a guard of twenty-odd men, of whom two were killed in the fiercest resistance and thirteen taken prisoner, including ten soldiers, one sergeant loyal to the said Neto, and two Black men belonging to the same; two carts from the equipment of Neto and his picket officers, one being a small covered cart and the other a large transport cart; six pairs of docile oxen to pull them. All this I accomplished, with the 2nd Battalion commanded by Brigadier Filipe Neri, as the other part remained at Passo do Caí with its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Fernandes; and although the restored gunboat had not yet arrived, despite already having been pushed and towed by poles for two and a half leagues downstream, I dispatched another detachment overland to meet it; on that occasion, I also requested that Brigadier Filipe Neri proceed by river on the steam barge with the force he commanded, which he promptly consented to, and both forces met it progressing at a distance of almost half a league from Passo do Pesqueiro.\n\nFrom there, I marched to Passo do Caí, at Contrato, to deliver the prisoners to Lieutenant Colonel Fernandes and continued with the carts to Ponta Rasa, capturing during the journey fifty head of cattle, which, along with the carts, I had transported by water to the encampment at Picada, where they remain, all at the disposal of Your Excellency’s orders. Neto was found with a writing desk closed, a large chest and two small ones with clothes and some goods, official documents and other correspondence papers, six baskets belonging to his picket officers also containing clothes, some goods, and papers; one and a half barrels of sugar, two barrels of wine, and some kitchen and dining utensils. His uniform of fine blue cloth embroidered in gold as general-in-chief of the rebels, a neat insignia of a scarlet fine cloth hat embroidered in gold with the legend of the Rio-grandense Republican Army, a sash of cloth embroidered in the back, a\n\nThis is what I have to report to the presence of Your Excellency.\n\nEncampment of Picada, April 11, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nMajor and Interim Commander of the 5th National Guard Corps."
