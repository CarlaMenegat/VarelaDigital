  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nIn compliance with Your Excellency's orders concerning the Guaíba river above, I disembarked at ten o’clock at night at Ponta Rasa, and having already sent a cavalry detachment commanded by Lieutenant Isaías Antônio Alz. to Faxinal to escort the war gunboat which had fallen into the hands of the rebels, whose protection I was advancing to; but before that, still during the night, I made my way to Passo Fundo to attack a rebel force of more than one hundred men commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Tomás Pereira, but he, already apprehensive, withdrew from that position. It was reported to me that he had sent a detachment of more than twenty men to Passo do Pesqueiro, to guard the crossing and escort some wagons of Antônio de Sousa Neto, general-in-chief of the anarchist forces. Immediately, on that same night, I proceeded to said crossing, not only to protect the detachment I had sent to retrieve the war gunboat from Faxinal but to capture said wagons; and, in fact, before reaching Passo do Pesqueiro, about half a league away and before dawn, I encountered said wagons with a guard of more than twenty men, of whom two were killed resisting strongly and thirteen taken prisoner, consisting of ten soldiers, a sergeant loyal to said Neto, and two blacks belonging to him; two wagons belonging to Neto’s staff and the officers of his picket, one being a covered cart and the other a large transport wagon; six teams of oxen trained to haul them. All this I accomplished with the 2nd Battalion commanded by Brigadier Filipe Neri, since the other part remained at Passo do Caí with its commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Fernandes. The restored gunboat had not yet arrived, despite having already been navigated downriver by poles and tow for two and a half leagues. I sent another detachment by land to meet it; on this occasion, I also requested Brigadier Filipe Neri to proceed by river on the steamboat with his force, who promptly complied, and both forces met it advancing at a distance of almost half a league from Passo do Pesqueiro.\n\nFrom there I marched to Passo do Caí, at Contrato, to deliver the prisoners to Lieutenant-Colonel Fernandes, and proceeded with the wagons to Ponta Rasa, where we captured fifty cattle en route, which, along with the wagons, I had loaded onto boats to be conveyed to the camp at Picada, where they now are, all at the disposal of Your Excellency’s orders. Neto’s quarters were found sealed, a large trunk belonging to him and two smaller ones with clothing and some merchandise, official papers and other correspondence, six baskets belonging to his picket officers also containing clothing, some merchandise and papers; one and a half barrels of sugar, two barrels of wine and some kitchen and table miscellanea. His uniform of fine blue cloth embroidered with gold as general-in-chief of the rebels, a neat scarlet fine cloth hat band embroidered with gold bearing the inscription of the Rio-grandense Republican Army, a decorated cloth over-girth, a\n\nThis is what I have to submit to Your Excellency.\n\nCamp at Picada, April 11, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Antônio Elzeário de Miranda e Brito.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nMajor and Acting Commander of the 5th Corps of National Guard."
