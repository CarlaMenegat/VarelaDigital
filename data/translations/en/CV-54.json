Neto found a closed desk of said, a large chest of said and two small ones with clothes and some goods, official documents, and other correspondence papers, six baskets from his officers of the detachment, also with clothes and some goods and papers; one and a half barrels of sugar, two barrels of wine, and some kitchen and table minutiae.
