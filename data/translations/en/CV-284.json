  "translation": "The Government orders that Your Excellency Lieutenant Colonel Guedes and the person duly authorized by João Pedro Ramirez deliver the portion of cattle for slaughter and breeding that can be separated from the farms of the enemies of the Republic, in order to be provided to the said Ramirez, as appropriate, with the value of goods he supplied for the army; and for this reason, I highly recommend the delivery I refer to, and at least 4 to 5 thousand head of cattle.\n\nIn the receipt to be required when the cattle is delivered, it should be mandated to classify the number of fat and lean steers, the number of fat and lean cows, the number of bulls, and finally the number of breeding cattle, because all these classes have different prices."
