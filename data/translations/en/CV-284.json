  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nThe Government commands that Your Lordship, Lieutenant-Colonel Guedes, and the person competently authorized by João Pedro Ramirez, deliver the portion of cattle for slaughter and breeding that it is possible to separate from the farms of the enemies of the Republic, so that the said Ramirez may be compensated, as is proper, for the value of the goods he supplied to the army; and for this reason he strongly recommends the delivery to which I refer, amounting to at least 4 to 5 thousand head of cattle.\n\nIn the receipt to be demanded when the cattle are delivered, you must have classified the number of fat and lean yearling steers, the number of fat and lean cows, the number of bulls counted, and finally the number of breeding cattle, because all these classes have different prices.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nSecretariat of Finance Affairs in Piratini, January 22, 1839  \nDomingos José de Almeida  \nMost Illustrious Sir Joaquim dos Santos Prado Lima, General Commander of Police of the Municipality of Alegrete.\n\nJanuary 22, 1839  \nMinister of Finance  \nSecretariat of the Republic\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Joaquim dos Santos Prado Lima, General Commander of Police of the Municipality of Alegrete. From the Minister of Finance."
