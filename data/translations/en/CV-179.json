  "translation": "CITIZEN DOMINGOS JOSÉ DE ALMEIDA TO HIS COMPATRIOTS\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, 1835: PRINTING HOUSE OF V. F. DE ANDRADE, RUA DA PONTE.\n\nRIO-GRANDENSES! So that our brothers from the other provinces of the Empire may assess the nature of that fierce and wicked party which sustained and directed the administration of Mr. Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga, which your virtues and your patriotism have just overcome, I will reveal the reasons that originated my imprisonment and all that occurred in the painful seventeen days during which I was confined in the narrow chamber of the war schooner “19 de Outubro,” so that you may see with horror the fate that awaited you, had the protective genius of Brazil abandoned the Holy Cause you defend.\n\nFully aware of your just indignation against an anti-national, despotic, turbulent, and wasteful administration, like that of Mr. Braga, as soon as I learned of the movements of September 20 in the capital, I enlisted in your ranks, protesting to die with you or to save the Fatherland from the monsters that oppressed it.\n\nFirm in this purpose and confident in the sentiments of the officers and national guards under my command, the patriotism of the distinguished Major Pinto, Captain Pinto, Lieutenant Pinto, and Ensign Felizardo, of the infantry of the city of Pelotas, and above all the Brazilian spirit of Major José Jerônimo do Amaral, officers and national guards of the squadron under his command, I began to lay out the first steps of the plan to promptly blunt the insidious schemes of Mr. Braga, should he, in vain efforts of resistance, wish to involve us in the horrors of anarchy; when, emboldened by advice received in Rio Grande, the said Mr. Braga appeared in the city of Pelotas, a worthy colony of the retrogrades of our Province, unfurling the banner of civil war.\n\nThe grudges caused during... upon the landing of Mr. Braga, intensified the parties at that moment; and while I was thinking of ways to avoid premature clashes, at around eleven o’clock at night, part of the squadron under my command appeared requesting my assistance to arrest Mr. Braga. Nothing was easier at the time; however, nothing was more unpleasant for liberals. The matter became serious in view of the reasons I opposed, and it was necessary to follow a course to prevent troubles. It occurred to me to present myself in the city with that force, and engage the Chamber to, under such pretext, request Mr. Braga to desist from his null projects of resistance to the will of the province’s majority. With these views, I placed myself at the head of the force and appeared in the city, where part of the infantry, major and officers of the 12th Company of the National Guard soon joined me, also sharing the desire to arrest Mr. Braga. The magistrate appeared, too annoyed with armed men, which caused several — outbursts — that would have escalated if I had not intervened, giving cheers to the aims of the reverence of Brazilians. After the magistrate calmed down, I was able to convince him of the necessity of a conference between him and some reputable persons of the city, which took place at his own house. In this conference it was agreed that no representations be made to Mr. Braga, but that only municipal police measures be taken to avoid disorder in the crisis we found ourselves in, keeping the city in suspense, without aligning with parties in order not to compromise or attract the hatred of the victor; aspiring nothing more, thus having saved victims, I returned with my companions, whom I had post one league outside the city. On that same month - good order Emphasized in the original. - to join the ranks of Major Marques, the first advance of legality. My companions sought me a second time, complaining of betrayal; I demanded explanations from one of the conference participants; this was given, denying the rumor of arrest; shortly after they warned me that the city was in distress, because it was said that knowing I was going to be arrested, I was marching with my people to take revenge; I also denied this assertion, and all was calmed. Two days later, one of the conference members approached me and warned that, in view of the hostility raised against me throughout the city, I should be cautious, although he promised to inform me of any news or orders concerning me. As soon as this compassionate soul left me, I learned that a young servant of mine, whom I had sent to Arroio Grande when I conceived the plan to make Mr. Braga desist from the attempt to resist the general will of the Province, to withdraw the national force stationed there to avoid bloodshed in case it clashed with Major Marques’s troops, had been imprisoned since the previous day for having delivered official papers to the chambers of this city and Rio Grande.\n\nSuch a precedent, concealed it seemed, apparently to keep me at ease, as later facts proved, so as to take possession of my person, relying on the promised fidelity of intelligence, was not enough to shield me from the trap being prepared for me; such was my good faith and sincerity in all I had done. On the night of that very day (October 4), between seven and eight o’clock, while I was in my yard enjoying the moonlight, surrounded by my family and guests, three horsemen arrived and one of them asked for me; I promptly approached him, who was dismounting at the same time. He, in a submissive voice, gave me recommendations from my esteemed friend Captain Antônio Neto, of whom, having to communicate—I might say Neto could arrive with the group he brought—I foolishly exposed the state of affairs regarding the current movement. After that, asking me to accompany him to speak with Neto himself, who had stayed behind the hedges of my farm, it was then that I realized my indiscretion, and I asked who he was, to which he stammered that he was Nico de Oliveira; and seeing the disproportionate differences between one and the other, I considered myself dead, thinking I was in the presence of the assassins of...\n\nIn such a situation, I was forced to obey in silence, so as not to plunge the dagger of despair into my wife, who was at the door watching us and still recovering from the childbirth she had had thirty-four days before. Behind the hedges, I found a squad of ten horsemen, on the saddle of one of whom my captor mounted me at the moment my wife approached, whom he ordered to be shot if she advanced another step, and commanded that we continue to the city. Halfway there, we turned back to arrest citizen Antônio Antunes de Porciúncula, my faithful companion and friend, from whose house he sent me off accompanied by three of his followers to prison, leaving the rest with my captor waiting for the said Antunes, who was not found. On this sortie, intrepid, I expected my assassination, when my guide, perhaps moved by pity for such harsh procedures, whispered to me — be calm, I will give you a chance to escape as soon as we reach the fence of... — and urged the horse. Shortly after, we heard a shot, and soon after the galloping of horsemen following us; the moonlight was very clear and we were in an open field from which we could not deviate without being suspected.\n\nThis caused us unease, and not without reason, from the voices we heard from afar of my captor ordering his men to run because they were many. Mr. Cândido Fernandes Lima, justice of the peace of the 2nd District, I turned toward the direction from which he was coming and saw he was heading to the group with a lady. I was already entering Rua da Igreja when I realized that my wife was that lady who came with Mr. Cândido, lamenting not seeing me and thinking I was dead. I then begged my captor to let me speak to my wife to dispel the illusion that so hurt her, when this monster with a man’s face, drawing a large pistol he carried, threw it at the head of the person guiding me, shouting — move forward or I’ll blow your head off... - Rio-grandenses! and all of you who love your spouses, imagine my pain and despair at seeing my wife devastated, and this action so unjust as well as inhuman? Where, where would such hardness and cruelty be seen other than in the possessed friends of good order Emphasized in the original. , defenders of the administration of the utterly foolish Mr. Braga!!!\n\nLike one amazed, I only recovered myself when placed in the center of a sizable assembly of good and armed men, who awaited the rich prey at the Largo of the Permanent Barracks... there, full of emphasis, my captor addressed the municipal magistrate in an arrogant tone and as one who proclaimed, the following speech — there he is, let him escape and I will abandon everything! — The magistrate, feigning surprise, demanded to know by whose order I had been arrested, to which the brave assassin of General Pantaleão Sotelo when sold to be robbed in 1820 replied — it was by the order of the President. Surrounded by arms, at the first person I knew, Mr. , I asked to have my desolate wife found and to assure her of my existence, presenting my tobacco box to prove it; this gentleman not only granted me such a relevant favor, for which I will always recall with gratitude,\n\nThe ferocity stood out in this shining gathering, a faithful organ of the nature of the Braga supporters. A carpenter officer named Joaquim José de Sousa, who was working in my house at the time and who had the indiscretion to accompany my wife when she frantically roamed the streets looking for me, and to offer her shoes, was, for such a great crime, imprisoned at the very moment I was informed of it with demonstrations of sentiment; from this imprisonment he escaped, accepting a weapon and joining the ranks of justice Emphasized in the original. . The same fate befell Mr. , who, acknowledging the courtesies he said I had rendered him when he came from Pernambuco, had the audacity to express feelings toward me upon seeing me in that state; and the very illustrious Mr. , leader of that holy party and entirely worthy of it, tormented me with mockeries... which I, with great effort, was able to endure in silence. Regaining some calm amid the tangle of vehement emotions, I sought to inquire who my most humane captor was, and my indignation escalated when I was told it was the infamous Basílio Ferreira Bica, my old friend in São Gabriel!!! But he had embraced the cause of good order Emphasized in the original. , and that was enough to make him fierce. On the morning of the 5th, despite the municipal magistrate’s promise that I would be kept even in his house — to better receive the consolations of my wife and children — I was summoned to immediately board the steamship to be taken to Rio Grande.\n\nThe magistrate’s promise made me refrain from sending for clothes from my house so I could appear decent; and thus, with only a tattered muleteer’s outfit and what I had on, I accompanied the justices of the peace and inspectors assigned to take me. The force marched after cheers were given to Mr. , to the Constitution, etc., mixed with Commander Bica and the municipal magistrate; and we proceeded in this direction. Mr. Cândido Fernandes Lima, Rio-grandenses, not only supplied me with a good bundle of clothes but also a note of 100,000 réis, an act that still wrings tears of gratitude from me as I write these lines, and with pleasure I recommend him to your respect and esteem, as well as Mr. João Rodrigues Ribas, who, when I was boarding the steamship, sent me 50 patacões: assistance I accepted, already foreseeing the fate I would endure under the fury of the most idiotic and evil of caudillos, Mr. Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga. Shortly after we departed, the national guardsmen of the infantry guarding me told me that Major José de Melo Pacheco de Resende, who was on the same ship but whom I had not yet seen because I was already interdicted, was telling whoever would listen that in the intercepted official papers of my head foreman, who was also imprisoned with me, orders to execute slave revolts were found, which made me, as it made him, upset by such an atrocious and vile slander! It is, however, surprising that Major Melo would advance such a claim, because if such a plan existed, he would necessarily have been invited, since there is no slave more enslaved than the major himself, etc… We touched at Vila do Norte, and finally docked in the city of Rio Grande at about three in the afternoon; I believe they would have strangled me had the door of the ship’s lounge not been guarded by the national guards who accompanied me: for the swarm of parasites of good order Emphasized in the original. was such, and the whispering so evident, their wicked intentions could easily be foreseen, and I personally knew them well when, upon stepping into the skiff that took me to my prison, a voice rose saying — throw him into the water for good order Emphasized in the original.!! The one who wanted to dominate this province, the homeland of heroes, with very rare exceptions!!! During the trip from Vila do Norte to Rio Grande I also learned that Second Lieutenant Luís Alves dos Santos Marques, who was at the Vila do Norte pier when the ship landed, had promised to chain me with the heaviest shackle if I fell into his hands; and, as I was bound for the schooner under his command, I trembled recalling the tortures that awaited me; but, in fairness, I must say that despite the stern manner in which he received and treated me during my imprisonment, not allowing me to be served by my slave, for visitors from my friends, to go out on deck for fresh air more than three times, or to address any letters or papers without them being read and corrected by him, nevertheless, I was free to eat when I wished and of whatever there was, and for this I am grateful to him.\n\nAll, or nearly all, conversations he had with me revolved around the prosperous state of the defenders of Mr. , and anyone can judge the interest I took in that untamed and fierce horde. On the fifth day of my imprisonment, among other consolations, he said the hostility against me was such that they had even asked him to poison me; and though I did not think him the sort to stoop to such an inhuman invitation, fearing some engagement I might not resist, I immediately asked to be sent to Rio de Janeiro, where, outside the influence of the wild legalists Emphasized in the original. , I would be safe from assassins and relieved of torture, although farther from my seven innocent children and my spouse. To complete all coherently, my wife informed me that a debtor of mine and two of my creditors, erecting themselves as something only they can name, the day following my arrest sent circulars to take charge of my house.\n\nThis honorable step Emphasized in the original. , at the moment when the world was closed to me and a revolution closed the door to all transactions, clearly shows the intention to take from me five what perhaps was worth a hundred, leaving my family exposed to hunger and nakedness, and me to the curse of absent creditors.\n\nCarried away by these melancholy reflections on the harshness and nature of a political party which breathed only atrocities, stinging tears wetted my face, foreseeing the fate that awaited the flower of the Province, if the arms’ successes favored these unbridled cannibals when, placing a table in the center of my narrow prison room, Doctor José Vieira Braga and his clerk entered; the first told me he had come to interrogate me about my crimes and then did so, asking me with what intention I went with armed force to the city of Pelotas, although having promised in a speech given in the Provincial Assembly that I would make a revolution, showing by my deeds that I verified my promise. To this I responded that my going to the city of Pelotas had no other purpose than to blunt the horrors of anarchy, making known to him that his obstinacy against the opinion of the province’s majority, besides being ridiculous, would compromise peaceful citizens and ignite endless and ruinous rivalries. That, regarding my speech, I did not see how that figure, which I used then, could apply to the province’s movements, much less make me guilty; being irresponsible for opinions I expressed, as a deputy, within the Provincial Assembly. Disagreeing with this, the magistrate continued that in the same Assembly I had declared that the day of vengeance would come; and that, as this revolution appeared against the authority referred to then, it was presumable that such a bold threat was already based on foundations that could not fail. Weary of a dialogue unrelated to the issue, though sufficient to demonstrate my troubles, Mr. , did not see, facing the borders to stumble, summoning against him the vengeance of the inhabitants of an entire Province, tired of suffering him and willing to resist him if he continued in folly just like this, of ordering to instruct my process twice in an irregular jurisdiction; because having my domicile in the city of Pelotas, and being imprisoned at the anchorage of Vila do Norte, I had just been summoned to the judgment of the City of Rio Grande, where better and more conveniently he found elements to satisfy his perverse, rancorous and vindictive spirit, disguised under the appearance of a lamb. The magistrate left, and I, left to my usual reflections, thought: if the sight of a wife about to succumb and the innocent tears of tender children do not soften the rage of the wicked, what fate awaits the majority of my fellow provincials if by some accident this monster again seizes the supreme command of the Province!! What devastations… what heaps of ruins!! Fortunately, these ideas had not faded from my imagination yet, when the blast of countless rockets again plunged me into painful distress. The blood of Brazilians, which Brazilians had them shed on the banks of Arroio Grande, was announced with such thunder in the city of Rio Grande, by the friends of good order Emphasized in the original. , that even today the memory makes the coldest chest palpitate with indignation. The preparations, however, for a prompt journey that immediately followed this improper joy, informed me too much — even there in the darkness of my prison — that heaven had finally heard the chords of justice. My hardships multiplied, paper and ink were withheld from me; and I left for the bar without bidding farewell to my dear family. There, resigned even to some violent assassination, I waited, torn by pain, for the moment to possibly leave forever this blessed province, leaving behind everything, after the homeland, that is dearest to me.\n\nOn the fifth day of a life—Mr. Braga appeared Major Manuel Marques de Sousa, who, unlike others of his creed, did not hesitate to speak to me, expressing surprise that I was still kept imprisoned and promising me immediate freedom if I spoke to the President of the gunboats, making me at the same time feel it was useful that I be home the same day if possible. This latter assertion again threw me into agitated plans, thinking some disaster had occurred in my family and exposing to Mr. Marques such fear, he had the kindness to dissipate it, saying he saw in my imprisonment a pretext for persecutions and cruel reprisals, and that he had expressed himself that way so I could avoid violence by appearing.\n\nHe went to the President; half an hour later, a delegation from the City of Rio Grande Municipal Chamber came to the residence of the same, shortly after the commander of the schooner also arrived there, and with pleasure informed me that I was free and a skiff was at my disposal for my return. However, just as my trunks were being removed from my suit, Mr. Manuel Gomes da Silva, member of the Chamber and of the aforementioned delegation, arrived, who, approaching me with his usual docility, explained that he had come to fetch me following a requisition from the respected body he belonged to. Extremely moved, I prepared to follow him. But the schooner commander, objecting to my following Mr. Gomes, alarmed me, suspecting the news of my release was a trick to mock my credulity and the Chamber’s requisition. Mr. Gomes, I believe the same as Mr. Braga, gave his word of honor that he had freed me, and encountering the obstacle to take me with him, since he came for no other purpose, he returned to Mr. Braga to impose on him the reasons opposing my departure; and the commander then allowed him to wait until I dressed; Mr. Israel arrived at the schooner and after a brief interview with the commander called me aside and explained that, having Mr. Gomes indiscreetly told Mr. Braga that a great number of citizens of the city, and the troops, and the colonel, were impatiently waiting for me at the pier, he had orally ordered the commander not to let me follow Mr. Gomes especially because the Chamber had by then already disavowed its authority, and he wanted thereby to show that I was not freed by its claims but by the reports of Marques, presenting me afterward to prove what he said, the release order, which in fact referred to said Marques! Distrusting everything I witnessed, knowing the fickleness of Mr. Braga, however I asked Mr. Gomes to return, using the pretext of having to take longer with a settler, but that I would follow two or three hours later.\n\nMr. Gomes left, and I, disheartened, prepared to follow from afar, waiting that in the act of putting me in the skiff, new orders would detain me; and though I was mistaken about that, I still had to overcome putting myself out of the schooner’s fire range.\n\nOnce in the skiff, as soon as I sat and was no longer heard from the schooner, I managed to convince the crew not to return, even if chased by grapeshot, heading to the nearest shore from which, already out of gunfire and breathing safely, I went to the city of Rio Grande, whose inhabitants and outsiders received me in such manner that right there I considered myself richly reimbursed for all I had suffered. The next day (the 23rd), Vila do Norte, whose inhabitants also showed pleasure over my freedom. On the 24th I arrived at my house where, surrounded by wife and children and free from Bragan arrogance, we enacted, for a long time, the most pathetic scene; and on the 25th, in Pelotas, my friends and friends of liberty fulfilled my pleasure with the satisfaction that showed on their faces upon seeing me restored to their arms.\n\nRIO-GRANDENSES! With my release, you have achieved yet another triumph over the enemies of the Fatherland, but do not think your noble work complete unless a total forgetfulness of the past and a generous pardon to the deluded lead the revolution’s chariot to the ends it set. Therefore, do not stain the most perfect work of your hands with intrigue and hateful dissensions. Let all the inhabitants of the Continent embrace one another, and with one aim — the good of the Fatherland — direct our efforts steadfastly!\n\nPelotas, October 29, 1835.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nPorto Alegre, 1835: Printing House of V.
