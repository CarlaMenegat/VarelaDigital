  "translation": "RIO-GRANDENSES! So that our brothers from the provinces of the Empire can assess the nature of this fierce and wicked party that maintained and directed the administration of Mr. Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga, which your virtues and patriotism have just surpassed, I will unveil the reasons that led to my imprisonment and all that occurred during the stormy seventeen days I was confined in the narrow chamber of the war schooner \"19 de Outubro,\" so that you may see with horror the fate that awaited you if the protective spirit of Brazil abandoned the Holy Cause you defend.\n\nWell aware of your just indignation against an anti-national, despotic, turbulent, and wasteful administration, such as that of Mr. Braga, as soon as I learned of the movements on September 20 in the capital, I enlisted in your ranks, declaring I would die with you or save the Fatherland from the monsters that oppressed it.\n\nFirm in this purpose and confident of the feelings of the officers and national guards under my command, of the patriotism of the worthy Major Pinto, Captain Pinto, Lieutenant Pinto, and Ensign Felizardo, of the infantry of the city of Pelotas, and above all of the Brazilian spirit of Major José Jerônimo do Amaral, officers and national guards of his squadron, I laid the first outlines of the plan to be followed, to foil the insidious attempts of Mr. Braga at once, should he, in the futile effort of resistance, wish to involve us in the horrors of anarchy. Encouraged by advice received in Rio Grande, he presented himself in the city of Pelotas, a worthy colony of the reactionaries of our Province, unfurling the banner of civil war.\n\nThe ruthless blows given by... upon Mr. Braga's landing intensified the parties; and when I was thinking of ways to avoid premature ruptures, at around eleven o’clock at night, part of the squadron under my command approached me asking for my assistance to arrest Mr. Braga. Nothing could have been easier at that moment; however, nothing could be more undesirable to liberals. The situation became serious given the reasons I opposed, and it was necessary to follow an arbitrary choice to prevent discord. It occurred to me to present myself in the city with that force and urge the Council to, under such pretext, ask Mr. Braga to abandon his futile projects of resistance to the will of the majority of the Province. With this aim, I placed myself at the head of the force and appeared in the city, where soon part of the infantry, major, and officers of the 12th Company of the National Guard joined me, also breathing the desire to imprison Mr. Braga. The annoyed judge appeared too displeased with armed men, which produced various outbursts from him—there would have been more if I had not stepped in, cheering for the objects of Brazilian veneration. Once the said judge calmed down, I was able to convince him of the need for a conference between him and a few prominent people in the city, which took place at his own house. In this conference, it was decided that nothing should be done regarding representations to Mr. Braga, that only the municipal police should be dealt with, to avoid disorder in the crisis we found ourselves in, keeping the city in expectation, without siding with parties to avoid compromising or bringing down the hatred of the victor. Aspiring to save victims in this way, I returned with my companions, whom I ordered to disperse a league outside the city. In good order, to swell the ranks of Major Marques, the first advance of legality. My companions sought me a second time, complaining of betrayal; I demanded explanations from one of the conferees, who denied the rumor of imprisonment; shortly afterward, I was informed that the city was in distress, as it was said that, knowing I was to be arrested, I was marching with my people for revenge; I also denied this assertion, and we all calmed down. Two days later, one of the conferees sought me and warned me that, because of the discontent that had arisen against me throughout the city, I should be cautious, although he promised to inform me of any news or orders regarding me. As soon as this compassionate soul left me, I learned that a young servant of mine, whom I directed to Arroio Grande when I conceived the plan to convince Mr. Braga to abandon his attempt to resist the general will of the Province, to withdraw the national force stationed there, to avoid bloodshed should it encounter that of Major Marques, had been imprisoned since the previous day for having delivered documents to the Councils of this city and Rio Grande.\n\nSuch a precedent, concealed, as it seemed, with a view to keeping me inattentive, as later events proved, to gain control over my person, relying on the promised intelligence, was not enough to protect me from the trap that was prepared for me; such was my good faith and sincerity in all I had done. On the night of that same day (October 4), from seven to eight o'clock, while I was in my yard enjoying the moonlight, surrounded by my family and guests, three horsemen arrived, and one of them, asking for me, I promptly approached him as he dismounted at the same time. He, in a hushed voice, gave me recommendations from my esteemed friend Captain Antônio Neto, of whom, having something to communicate—I could hardly bring myself to expose the state of affairs regarding the current movement. After this, asking me to accompany him to talk to Neto, who was behind the walls of my field, I realized my indiscretion, and asked him who he was, to which he replied hesitantly that he was Nico de Oliveira; and noticing a disproportion between one and the other, I considered myself dead, thinking I was in the presence of the murderers of...\n\nIn such a situation, I had to obey in silence, so as not to stab my wife, who was at the door observing us, and still recovering from the childbirth she had experienced thirty-four days prior, with the dagger of desperation. Behind the walls, I found a party of ten horsemen, on whose back one of them made me mount when my wife was approaching, ordering her to fire if she advanced one more step, and commanded that we follow to the city. Halfway, we returned to arrest citizen Antônio Antunes de Porciúncula, my loyal companion and friend, from whose house I was dispatched in the company of three of his followers for the arrest, leaving the rest with the bully of my apprehender waiting for the mentioned Antunes, who was not found. In this exit, I awaited my assassination with courage, when my captor, perhaps feeling pity for such harsh proceedings, quietly told me—calm down, I will give you a chance the moment we reach the enclosure of...—and hastened the horse. Shortly thereafter, we heard a shot, and even more the thunder of the horsemen following us: the moonlight was clear, and we were now in an open field, from which we could not deviate without being detected.\n\nThis caused us unease, and not without reason, given the voices we heard from a distance from my captor, ordering his men to run because there were many of Mr. Cândido Fernandes Lima, peace judge of the 2nd District. I turned to the side from where he was coming and saw that he was heading to the party with a lady. I was already on the street of the Church when I noticed that my wife was that lady coming with Mr. Cândido, by the lament she made of not seeing me and believing me dead. I then asked my captor to allow me to speak to my wife, to dispel the illusion that so pained her, when this monster with the guise of a man, drawing a pistol he had, aimed it at the head of the person who was leading me, shouting—move forward, or I will blow your head off...—Rio-grandenses! and you all who love your spouses, imagine my pain and desperation, at the sight of my wife distressed, and this behavior so wicked and inhumane? Where, where would such cruelty and malice be seen, if not among the possessed friends of good order!!!\n\nLike a bewildered person, I was only aware when caught in the center of a large gathering of good and armed people, who in the square of the Permanent Barracks awaited the rich prey... there, emphatically, my captor addressed the municipal judge, with an arrogant tone, as one proclaiming, the following speech—there you have him, let him escape, and I will also leave everything to chance!—The judge, appearing surprised, demanded to know by whose order I had been arrested, to which satisfied the valiant assassin of General Pantaleão Sotelo when sold to strip him in 1820—by the order of the President. Surrounded by arms, to the first acquaintance I encountered, Mr., I asked to search for my desolate wife and to assure her that I was alive, presenting my tobacco box to confirm it; this gentleman not only rendered me this significant favor, which I shall always remember gratefully,\n\nFerocity was apparent in this excellent gathering, a true reflection of the nature of the braganese supporters. A carpenter officer named Joaquim José de Sousa, who was then working in my house and had the indiscretion to accompany my wife when, in her frenzy, she searched the streets for me, and offer her footwear, was arrested for such an enormous crime, at the very moment he informed me of it with sentimental demonstrations; he escaped from this arrest, accepting a weapon and joining the ranks of the justice. The same fate befell Mr., who, recognizing the favors that, he claims, I rendered to him when he came from Pernambuco, had the audacity to express feelings upon seeing me in that state; and the very illustrious Mr., leader of this holy party and worthy in all respects, tormented me with jibes... that, with great effort, I was able to endure in silence. Regaining some calm, in the midst of the turmoil of intense emotions, I sought to inquire who my humane captor was, and my indignation then surged, being named to me the infamous Basílio Ferreira Bica, my old friend in São Gabriel!!! But he had embraced the cause of good order, and that was enough to make him ferocious. On the morning of the 5th, and despite the promise of the municipal judge that I would be guarded even in his house—to better receive the consolations of my wife and children—I was summoned to follow immediately to the steamboat, in order to be transported to Rio Grande.\n\nThe judge's promise caused me to refrain from sending for clothes from my house with which I could appear decent; and thus, in a tattered outfit and only with what I had on my body, I accompanied the peace judges and inspectors, who were tasked with taking me. The force marched after the cheers given for the Lord, for the Constitution, etc., alongside Commander Bica and the municipal judge; and we, Mr. Cândido Fernandes Lima, said he was passing by his house to provide me with clothes and that he committed to reporting about me; and we continued in this direction. Mr. Cândido, rio-grandenses, not only supplied me with a good bundle of clothes but also with a note for 100$000, an act that even as I write these lines brings tears of gratitude to my eyes, and I gladly recommend him to your respect and esteem, as I also do Mr. João Rodrigues Ribas, who, as I entered the schooner, sent me 50 patacões: assistance I accepted, foreseeing the fate I had to endure under the fury of the most idiotic and wicked of the leaders, such as Mr. Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga. Shortly after we cast off, the national guards of the infantry who were guarding me informed me that Major José de Melo Pacheco de Resende, who was aboard the same boat, but whom I had not yet seen because I was already interdicted, was telling anyone willing to listen that, in the documents intercepted from my foreman, who was also following me imprisoned, I was ordered to execute uprisings of slavery, turning me against, as he did, such a atrocious and black calumny! It is astonishing, however, that Major Melo would advance such a proposition, for if such a plan existed, he necessarily should have been invited, on account of the fact that there was no slave more enslaved than the same major, etc… We touched at the Northern village, and finally docked in the city of Rio Grande at around three o’clock in the afternoon; there I believe they would have strangled me, had it not been for the fact that the door of the ballroom of the boat was guarded by the national guards who accompanied me: for the swarm of parasites of good order and the murmur was such that their wicked intentions were easily foreseen, and I particularly knew them when, upon jumping into the skiff that took me to my imprisonment, a voice shouted—throw him into the good order waters!!! That which you wanted to dominate this province, the homeland of heroes, with very few exceptions!!! On the trip from Norte to Rio Grande, I also learned that 2nd Lieutenant Luís Alves dos Santos Marques, who was at the Northern wharf when the boat arrived, had promised to bring me down to my knees if I fell into his hands; and, as I went to the schooner under his command, I trembled at the thought of the tortures that awaited me; however, in the interest of truth, I must say that, despite the austere manner in which he received and treated me throughout my imprisonment, not allowing me to service with my servant, to receive visits from my friends, to breathe in the open air on deck more than three times, to direct a letter or paper to anyone without being read and amended by him, still I had the freedom to eat when I desired and from whatever there was, and for that alone I am thankful to him.\n\nAll, or almost all, the conversations he had with me revolved around the prosperous state of the defenders of the Lord, and anyone could judge the interest I would take in such a wild and ferocious horde. On the fifth day of my imprisonment, among other things to console me, he said that such was the discontent against me that they even asked him to poison me; and, although I did not form the idea of him being inclined to accept this inhumane invitation, nonetheless, fearing some involvement I could not resist, I immediately requested to be sent to Rio de Janeiro, where, outside the influence of the wild legalists, I could find shelter from assassins and be relieved from tortures, although being further away from my seven innocent children and my consort. To make everything consistent, I was informed by my wife that one of my debtors and two of my creditors, rising to a thing only they could name, had sent circulars the day after my arrest to take account of my house.\n\nThis step, at the moment when the world was closing in on me and a revolution had shut the door to all transactions, clearly reveals the intention to seize from me five what was perhaps worth a hundred, leaving my family exposed to hunger and nakedness, and me to the curse of absent creditors.\n\nTransported with this news to melancholy reflections on the harshness and nature of a political party that breathed nothing but atrocities, heartfelt tears moistened my face, foreseeing the fate waiting for the flower of the Province, if the outcomes of arms leaned in favor of these unrestrained cannibals when, setting a table in the center of the room of my narrow prison, Dr. José Vieira Braga and his clerk entered and took a seat; from that one, I was told to be interrogated about my crimes, and he subsequently did so, asking me with what purpose I went armed to the city of Pelotas, although having, in a speech given at the Provincial Assembly, promised to make a revolution, showing with facts that I verified my promise. To this, I responded that my visit to the city of Pelotas had no other aim than to cut off the horrors of anarchy, making known to the Lord that his obstinacy against the opinion of the majority of the Province, aside from being ridiculous, would compromise peaceful citizens and ignite endless and ruinous rivalries. That, regarding my speech, I did not see how that phrase, which I then used, could be applied to the movements of the Province, let alone to make it a crime; being not responsible for the opinions I expressed as a deputy in the precinct of the Provincial Assembly. Disagreeing with this, the judge continued that, in that same Assembly, I asserted that the day of vengeance would come; and that for this revolution to appear against the authority I referred to back then, it was presumed that such an adventurous threat was launched on bases that should not fail. Fed up with a dialogue unrelated to the issue, since it sufficiently demonstrated to me what the cause of my... Lord, did not see the lines to block, calling against himself the vengeance of the inhabitants of an entire Province, tired of suffering him and ready to resist him if he remained ungoverned in outrages just like this of ordering to instruct my process twice in a foreign court; because I had my domicile in the city of Pelotas, and having been imprisoned at the wharf of the Northern Village, I was just called to the judgment of the City of Rio Grande, where more suitably encountered elements to satiate his perverse, rancorous, and vengeful spirit, cloaked under the appearances of a lamb. The judge left, and I, given to customary ponderings, said: when the picture of a wife about to succumb and the innocent tears of tender children do not soften the rage of the wicked, what fate awaits the majority of my province mates, if by any unforeseen turn this monster once again seizes the supreme command of the Province!! What devastations... what heaps of ruins!! It was not long after these ideas had fled my mind when the roar of numerous fireworks once again plunged me into painful distress. The blood of Brazilians shed on the banks of Arroio Grande was announced so thunderously in the city of Rio Grande, by the friends of good order, that even today its memory makes the coldest heart throb with indignation. The preparations, however, for a swift journey that immediately followed this unexpected joy informed me too much—right there in the darkness of my prison—that heaven had finally heard the calls of justice. My deprivations were doubled; paper and ink were hidden from me; and I departed for the bar without bidding farewell to my dear family. There, resigned to some violent assassination, I awaited, cut with pains, the moment to leave perhaps forever this blessed province, leaving there everything, after the homeland, that is dearest to me.\n\nOn the fifth day of existence, Mr. Braga, Major Manuel Marques de Sousa appeared who, not ashamed, like others of his creed, to address me, showed surprise that I was still confined and promised me freedom immediately, if I spoke to the President of the gunboats, making me also feel it would be useful for me to be at home that same day, if possible. This last assertion threw me again into agitated combinations, fearing there had been some misfortune in my family, and exposing this concern to Mr. Marques, he kindly dispelled it, saying that seeing in my imprisonment a pretext for bloody persecutions and reprisals, he expressed himself that way, so I might avoid violations by appearing.\n\nHe went to the President; half an hour later, a delegation of the Municipal Chamber of the City of Rio Grande came, and shortly after the commander of the schooner, who was also there, returned with manifestations of pleasure, announcing to me that I was free and a skiff was at my disposal for my return. Just as my belongings were being unloaded, Mr. Manuel Gomes da Silva, a member of the Chamber and of the above-mentioned delegation, arrived, who, approaching me with his natural gentleness, informed me that he had come to fetch me as a result of a request from the respectable body of which he was a part. Deeply moved, I was ready to follow him. But the commander of the schooner, contending that I should not follow Mr. Gomes, frightened me, thinking that the news of my release was a mockery to tease my credulity and the request of the Chamber. Mr. Gomes, I believe, having given his word of honor to have me released, and facing the obstacle of taking me with him, as he had not come for any other reason, would return to Mr. Braga to impose upon him the reasons against my departure; and the commander conformed to let him wait until I dressed, when Mr. Israel arrived at the schooner, who, after a brief interview with the commander, called me aside and explained that, having Mr. Gomes made the indiscretion of telling Mr. Braga that a large number of citizens of the city, and troops, and the colonel, were impatiently waiting for me at the wharf, he had ordered verbally to the commander not to let me go with Mr. Gomes, particularly because the Chamber had already then disowned his authority and wanted to show that I was not released by their complaints, but by virtue of the information of Mr. Marques, presenting to me afterward to confirm what he said, the order of release, which indeed referred to the said Marques! Distrusting everything I witnessed, due to my knowledge of the fickleness of Mr. Braga, I nonetheless begged Mr. Gomes to return, on the pretext of having to delay the final details of business with an emigrant, but would follow two or three hours later.\n\nMr. Gomes left, and I, disheartened, was preparing to follow him from afar, hoping that, in the act of boarding the skiff, new orders would stop me; and although I was deceived in this, I still had to overcome the hurdle of putting myself out of the range of the schooner's bullets.\n\nOnce inside the skiff, as soon as I sat down and no longer heard from the schooner, I managed to convince the crew not to turn back, even if fired upon, heading for the nearest beach, where, safely past the shots and breathing security, I headed to the city of Rio Grande, whose inhabitants and outsiders received me in such a way that right there I felt exuberantly rewarded for all my suffering. The next day (23), I reached the Northern Village, where its inhabitants also demonstrated their joy at my freedom. On the 24th, I arrived at my house, where, surrounded by my wife and children and free from the braganese oppression, we enacted, for a long time, the most pathetic scene; and on the 25th, in the city of Pelotas, my friends and the friends of freedom filled my joy with the satisfaction that reflected on their faces for seeing me restored to their arms.\n\nRIO-GRANDENSES! With my release, you have achieved another triumph against the enemies of the Fatherland, but do not think your noble efforts realized, without a total forgetting of the past and a generous forgiveness of the deceived leading the chariot of the revolution to the ends it aimed. Do not tarnish, therefore, the most perfect work of your hands with intrigues and hateful dissentions. Let us embrace all the inhabitants of the Continent, and towards one single aim—like the good of the Fatherland—let us direct our efforts firmly!"
