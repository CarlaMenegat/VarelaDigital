  "translation": "THE CITIZEN DOMINGOS JOSÉ DE ALMEIDA TO HIS COMPATRIOTS\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, 1835: PRINTING HOUSE OF V. F. DE ANDRADE, RUA DA PONTE.\n\nRIO-GRANDENSES! So that our brothers from the other provinces of the Empire may assess the nature of that fierce and perverse party that sustained and directed the administration of Senhor Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga, which your virtues and your patriotism have just overcome, I will disclose the reasons for my imprisonment and all that occurred during the tormenting seventeen days that I lay confined in the narrow chamber of the war schooner “19 de Outubro,” in order that you may see with horror the fate that awaited you, if the tutelary genius of Brazil were to abandon the Holy Cause you defend.\n\nWell aware of your just indignation against an anti-national, despotic, turbulent, and dissipative administration, such as that of Senhor Braga, as soon as I heard of the movements of September 20 in the capital, I enlisted in your ranks, protesting to die with you, or to save the Fatherland from the monsters that oppressed it.\n\nFirm in this purpose and assured of the feelings of the officers and national guards under my command, of the patriotism of the esteemed Major Pinto, Captain Pinto, Lieutenant Pinto, and Ensign Felizardo of the infantry of the city of Pelotas, and above all of the Brazilianism of Major José Jerônimo do Amaral, officers and national guards of the squadron under his command, I formulated the initial outlines of the plan to follow, to blunt at once the insidious designs of Senhor Braga, in case, in his futile resistance effort, he wanted to involve us in the horrors of anarchy. At that moment, encouraged by advice received in Rio Grande, he presented himself in the city of Pelotas, a worthy colony of the retrogrades of our Province, unfurling the banner of civil war.\n\nThe bitter quarrels provoked by... upon Senhor Braga's landing intensified the parties; and when I was thinking of ways to avoid premature ruptures, part of the squadron under my command appeared at around eleven o'clock at night requesting my assistance to arrest Senhor Braga. Nothing was easier on that occasion; yet nothing was also more unpleasant to liberals. The case became serious in view of the reasons I opposed, and it was necessary to choose a course to prevent disasters. It occurred to me to present myself in the city with that force, and engage the Chamber to, with that pretext, beseech Senhor Braga to desist from his futile projects of resistance to the will of the majority of the Province. With this in mind, I placed myself at the head of the force and appeared in the city, where soon part of the infantry, the major and officers of the 12th Company of the National Guard, joined me, also harboring desires for Senhor Braga's arrest. The judge of law appeared quite vexed with armed men around, which generated several exclamations that would have escalated if I had not quashed them by giving cheers to the objects of veneration of Brazilians.\n\nAfter calming the said judge, I was able to convince him of the necessity of a conference between him and some respected persons of the city, which took place at his own house. In this conference, it was agreed that no representations be made to Senhor Braga, and that only the municipality's police matter should be addressed to avoid disorders in the crisis in which we found ourselves, keeping the city on alert, without siding with parties to avoid compromising or drawing upon oneself the hatred of the victor; and aspiring to nothing more, having thus saved victims, I returned with my companions, whom I ordered to disband one league outside the city. That month—good order Emphasized in the original.—to reinforce the ranks of Major Marques, the first advanced guard of legality. My companions sought me a second time, complaining of betrayal; I demanded explanations from one of the conference attendees; this was given to me denying the rumor of imprisonment; shortly after they notified me that the city was in consternation, saying that, knowing I was to be arrested, I was marching with my men to take revenge; I also denied this assertion, and we all calmed down. After two days, one of the attendees sought me out and warned that, given the hostility that had arisen against me throughout the city, I should be cautious, although he promised to inform me of any news or orders regarding me. As soon as this compassionate soul left me, I learned that a young servant of mine, whom I had sent to Arroio Grande when I conceived the plan to make Senhor Braga desist from the attempt to resist the general will of the Province, to withdraw the national force stationed there in order to avoid bloodshed should it confront that of Major Marques, had been imprisoned since the previous day for having delivered documents to the Chambers of this city and of Rio Grande.\n\nSuch a precedent, hidden, it seemed, to keep me off guard, as later events showed, in order to seize my person, relying on the promised intelligence’s fidelity, was not enough to protect me from the trap that was being prepared for me; such was my good faith and sincerity in all that I had done. On the night of the same day (October 4th), from seven to eight o'clock, while I was in my courtyard enjoying the moonlight, surrounded by my family and guests, three horsemen arrived and, one of them asking for me, I promptly approached him as he dismounted. He, in a submissive voice, brought me recommendations from my esteemed friend Captain Antônio Neto, from whom, having to communicate—Neto could come with the men he brought—I had the recklessness to expose the state of affairs regarding the current movement. After that, asking me to accompany him to speak with the same Neto, who had remained behind the hedges of my plantation, was when I realized my indiscretion, and I asked him who he was, to which, stammering, he said he was Nico de Oliveira; and having noticed disproportionate differences between them, I considered myself dead, thinking I was in the presence of the assassins of...\n\nIn such a situation, it was necessary to obey silently, so as not to plunge the dagger of despair into my wife, who was at the door observing us, still convalescing from childbirth she had thirty-four days before. Behind the hedges, I found a group of ten mounted men, on the back of one of whom my captor made me mount just as my wife was approaching, at whom he ordered fire if she advanced another step, and ordered that we proceed to the city. Halfway there, we turned to arrest citizen Antônio Antunes de Porciúncula, my faithful companion and friend, from whose house my captor dispatched me in the company of three of his cohorts to prison, remaining with the rest with my captor awaiting said Antunes, who was not found. On this departure, I, intrepid, awaited my assassination, when my guide, perhaps moved by such harsh measures, whispered calmly to me—“rest assured, I will get you free as soon as we reach the enclosure of...” — and spurred the horse. Shortly after, we heard a shot and then the galloping of riders pursuing us: the moonlight was very bright, and we were then in an open field from which we could not stray without being noticed.\n\nThis caused us unease, and rightly so, by the voices we heard at a distance from my captor, ordering his men to run because they were many. Senhor Cândido Fernandes Lima, justice of the peace of the 2nd District, I turned to the side from which he came and saw him heading towards the group with a lady. I was already inside Igreja Street when I realized that my wife was that lady walking with Senhor Cândido, lamenting not seeing me and fearing I was dead. I then begged my captor to let me speak to my wife to dispel the illusion that saddened her so much, when that monster with the figure of a man, drawing a pistol he carried, threw it against the head of the person leading me, shouting—“move forward or I’ll blow your brains out...” Rio-grandenses! And you all who love your wives, imagine the pain and despair I felt, seeing my wife distraught and witnessing such unjust and inhuman behavior! Where, where could one see such hardness and cruelty, if not in the possessed friends of good order Emphasized in the original., defenders of the administration of the most foolish Senhor Braga!!!\n\nAs if stunned, I only took notice of myself when placed in the midst of a large gathering of fine and armed people, who awaited the prized catch at the Largo of the Permanent Barracks... There, filled with emphasis, my captor addressed the municipal judge in an arrogant tone, as if proclaiming, the following speech—“There he is, let him escape and I will also give up everything!” The judge, appearing surprised, demanded to know by whose order I was arrested, to which satisfied the brave assassin of General Pantaleão Sotelo when sold to be stripped of him in 1820—that it was by the order of the President. Surrounded by arms, at the first person I recognized, Senhor , I asked him to look for my desolate wife and assure her that I existed, presenting my tobacco box to prove it; this gentleman not only rendered me such a significant favor, for which I will always remember gratefully,\n\nFerocity stood out in this brilliant assembly, a faithful organ of the nature of the Bragarist partisans. A carpenter officer named Joaquim José de Sousa, who was then working in my house and had the indiscretion to accompany my wife when she frantically wandered the streets looking for me, and to offer her footwear, was, for such a great crime, arrested, just as I became aware of it with sentimental displays; from which imprisonment he escaped, accepting a weapon and joining the ranks of justice Emphasized in the original. The same fate befell Senhor , who, recognizing favors, he said, I had done for him when he came from Pernambuco, had the audacity to express sentiments about seeing me in that state; and the most illustrious Senhor , leader of that holy party and worthy of it in every way, tormented me with jibes... which, with great effort, I could silently endure. Regaining some peace amid the flood of vehement emotions, I sought to inquire who my very humane captor was, and my indignation then rose as I was named the infamous Basílio Ferreira Bica, my old friend in São Gabriel!!! But he had embraced the cause of good order Emphasized in the original., and that was enough to make him fierce. On the morning of the 5th, and despite the municipal judge’s promise that I would be guarded even in his house—to better receive the consolations of my wife and children—I was summoned to immediately go to the steamship to be transported to Rio Grande.\n\nThe judge’s promise led me not to send for clothes to appear decently at my house; and even so, dressed in a patched muleteer’s outfit and only with what I wore, I accompanied the judges of peace and inspectors assigned to take me. The force marched after the cheers given to Senhor , to the Constitution, etc., mixed with Commander Bica and the municipal judge; and we proceeded in that direction. Senhor Cândido Fernandes Lima, Rio-grandenses, not only provided me with a good bundle of clothes but also a note of 100$000, a gesture that still brings tears of gratitude to my eyes as I write these lines, and with pleasure I recommend him to your respect and esteem, as well as Senhor João Rodrigues Ribas, who, as I boarded the ship, sent me 50 patacões: aid that I accepted, already foreseeing the fate that awaited me under the fury of the most idiotic and worst of caudillos, Senhor Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga. Shortly after we departed, the National Guards of the infantry who guarded me said that Major José de Melo Pacheco de Resende, who was aboard the same ship but whom I had not yet seen because I was already forbidden, was telling anyone who would listen that, in the intercepted documents addressed to my foreman, who was also imprisoned with me, I was ordered to execute a plan to incite a slave revolt, which estranged me, as it did others, with such an atrocious and wicked slander! It is surprising, however, that Major Melo would advance such a proposal, for if such a plan existed, he should necessarily have been invited, since there is no slave more enslaved than the same major, etc... We landed in Vila do Norte and finally docked in the city of Rio Grande at around three in the afternoon; there I believe they would have strangled me if the door of the steerage of the ship had not been guarded by the National Guards who accompanied me: for the swarm of parasites of good order Emphasized in the original. and the whispering predicted their damned intentions, and I personally recognized them when, upon stepping onto the skiff that took me to my prison, a voice arose saying—“Throw him into the water of good order Emphasized in the original.! The one you wanted to dominate this province, homeland of heroes, with very rare exceptions!!!” On the trip from the North to Rio Grande, I also learned that the 2nd Lieutenant Luís Alves dos Santos Marques, who was found at the pier of the North when the ship docked, had promised to chain me down with the heaviest shackle if I fell into his hands; and on my way to the schooner under his command, I trembled recalling the torments prepared for me; however, in fairness, I must say that despite the austere manner in which he received and treated me during my imprisonment, not allowing me to serve myself with my slave, not permitting visits from my friends, allowing me to breathe fresh air on the deck only three times, nor to address letters or papers to anyone without being read and corrected by him, yet I had the freedom to eat whenever I wished and whatever was available, and for that alone I am grateful.\n\nAlmost all the conversations he had with me centered on the prosperous state of Senhor ’s defenders, and anyone could judge the interest I took in that wild and fierce horde. On the fifth day of my imprisonment, among other consolations he gave me, he said that the hostility against me was such that they had even asked him to poison me; supposing I did not think he would see fit to accept such an inhuman request, but fearing some attempt I could not resist, I immediately asked to be sent to Rio de Janeiro, where, outside the influence of the savage legalists Emphasized in the original., I might be safe from assassins and relieved of torments, although farther from my seven innocent children and my wife. To add coherence, I was informed by my wife that a debtor of mine and two of my creditors, erecting themselves into something only they can name, had the day after my imprisonment circulated letters to take charge of my house.\n\nThis honorable step Emphasized in the original., at the moment the world was closing on me and a revolution closed the door to all transactions, clearly shows the intention to tear from me for five what perhaps was worth a hundred, leaving my family exposed to hunger and nakedness, and me to the curse of absent creditors.\n\nCarried away by such news into melancholy reflections on the harshness and nature of a political party that breathed nothing but atrocities, tears of feeling moistening my face, foreseeing the fate awaiting the flower of the Province if the fortunes of arms leaned in favor of these unbridled cannibals when, setting a table in the center of the room of my narrow prison, Dr. José Vieira Braga and his clerk entered; by the former I was told he came to question me about my crimes, and then proceeded to do so, asking what purpose led me with armed force to the city of Pelotas, despite having, in a speech at the Provincial Assembly, promised to make a revolution, showing by facts to verify my promise. To this, I replied that my trip to the city of Pelotas had no other purpose than to cut short the horrors of anarchy, informing Senhor that his obstinacy against the opinion of the majority of the Province, besides being ridiculous, would involve peaceful citizens and ignite endless and ruinous rivalries. That, as for my speech, I saw no reason that figure I then used could be applied to the Province’s movements or, less so, make me a criminal; I am not responsible for the opinions that, as a deputy, I delivered inside the Provincial Assembly hall. The judge disagreed, continuing that in the same Assembly I had asserted that the day of vengeance was to come; and that appearing this revolution against the authority I had then referred to, it was to be presumed that such a rash threat was already on foundations that should not fail. Weary of a dialogue unrelated to the question, though sufficient to show me the cause of my cri- Senhor , did not see the borders colliding, calling against him the vengeance of an entire Province’s inhabitants, tired of suffering him and determined to resist him if he continued mad as well as to send my trial to two foreign forums; for having my domicile in the city of Pelotas, and being imprisoned in the harbor of Vila do Norte, I had been summoned to the court of the city of Rio Grande, where it was easier and more convenient to find elements to satisfy his perverse, spiteful, and vengeful temper, cloaked under the appearances of a lamb. The judge left, and I, left to my usual thoughts, said: when the image of a wife about to perish and the innocent tears of tender children do not soften the malice of the wicked, what fate awaits the bulk of my fellow provincials if, by some unforeseen event, this monster again wields supreme power over the Province!! What devastation... what heaps of ruins!! Thankfully these ideas had not faded from my imagination, when the noise of countless rockets once again plunged me into painful anguish. The blood of Brazilians, shed by Brazilians on the banks of Arroio Grande, was announced so loudly in the city of Rio Grande by the friends of good order Emphasized in the original., that even today its memory stirs indignation in the coldest chest. The preparations, however, of a prompt trip that immediately followed this unmarked joy informed me too much—there in the darkness of my prison—that the heavens had finally heard the cries of justice. My deprivations doubled, pen and ink were hidden from me; and I departed for the harbor without bidding farewell to my dear family. There, resigned even to some violent assassination, scarred by pain, I awaited the moment to perhaps leave forever this blessed province, leaving behind everything, after the homeland, that is dearest to me.\n\nOn the fifth day of an existên- Senhor Braga , Major Manuel Marques de Sousa appeared, who, not being shy like others of his creed, addressed me and expressed surprise that I was still held in prison, promising me freedom immediately if I spoke to the President of the gunboats, making me, at the same time, feel that it would be useful for me to be home that same day if possible. This last statement threw me again into agitated schemes, thinking some misfortune had befallen my family and exposing this fear to Senhor Marques, who kindly dispelled it, saying that he saw in my imprisonment an excuse for persecutions and cruel reprisals, and that he had expressed himself in that way so that I might avoid violence by appearing.\n\nHe went to the President; half an hour later, a delegation from the Municipal Chamber of the City of Rio Grande passed by the president’s residence, the commander of the schooner, who was also there, shortly returned, and with displays of pleasure announced to me that I was free and an oar-skiff at my disposal for my return. However, as my trunks were being released, Senhor Manuel Gomes da Silva, member of the Chamber and of the above-mentioned delegation, arrived, who, approaching me with his usual gentleness, showed me that he had come to fetch me following a requisition from the respectable body he was part of. Deeply moved, I prepared to follow him. But the schooner commander, objecting to my following Senhor Gomes, frightened me, supposing the news of my release was a trick to mock my credulity and the Chamber's requisition. Senhor Gomes, I believe the same Senhor Braga, gave his word of honor of having freed me, and encountering the obstacle of taking me with him, having come for no other purpose, he would return to Senhor Braga to impose the reasons opposing my departure; then, the commander agreed to make him wait until I dressed; Senhor Israel arrived at the schooner, who, after a brief interview with the commander, called me aside and explained that Senhor Gomes indiscreetly told Senhor Braga that a great number of the city’s citizens, the troops, and the colonel were impatiently awaiting me at the pier, and he orally ordered the commander not to let me go with Senhor Gomes, particularly because the Chamber had already then disowned his authority and wanted to show that I was not freed by their complaints, but by the information of Marques, presenting me then to prove what he said, the release order, which indeed referred to said Marques! Suspecting everything I witnessed, due to the volatility of Senhor Braga, I nevertheless begged Senhor Gomes to return, under the pretext of having to delay the finalization of business with an emigrant, but that I would follow two or three hours later.\n\nSenhor Gomes left, and I, discouraged, was preparing to follow him from afar, hoping that, upon trying to board the skiff, new orders would detain me; and though I was mistaken in this, I still had to overcome and place myself out of reach of firefight from the schooner.\n\nGetting into the skiff, as soon as I sat down and was no longer heard from the schooner, I managed to convince the crew not to return, even if pursued by rifle fire, heading to the nearest shore where, once out of gunfire and breathing safely, I headed to the city of Rio Grande, whose inhabitants and outsiders received me in such a manner that I considered myself generously rewarded for all I had suffered. The next day (23), Vila do Norte, where its inhabitants also showed keen pleasure for my freedom. On the 24th, I arrived home, where, surrounded by my wife and children and free from Braganese tyranny, we portrayed, for a long time, the most pathetic scene; and on the 25th, in the city of Pelotas, my friends and freedom’s friends fulfilled my joy with the satisfaction that shone on their faces at seeing me restored to their arms.\n\nRIO-GRANDENSES! With my release, you have won yet another triumph against the enemies of the Fatherland, but do not think your noble works are complete without a total forgetting of the past and a generous forgiveness of the misguided leading the revolution’s chariot to the ends it proposed. Do not stain, therefore, the most perfect work of your hands with intrigue and hateful dissensions. Let us embrace all the inhabitants of the Continent, and direct our efforts firmly towards a single goal—the good of the Fatherland!\n\nPelotas, October 29, 1835.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nPorto Alegre, 1835: Printing House of V.
