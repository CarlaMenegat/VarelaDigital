  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nSince I arrived here on the 5th of the current month, I have been diligently working to prepare 350 jackets, as many trousers and shirts, and 450 ponchos for this division, requesting an additional 100 ponchos for my legion, being aware of its condition, etc.; and despite my efforts I have, so to speak, obtained nothing; the cause of this remains with me, so as not to provoke intrigues. I requested six contos, which I was ordered to be given in copper coins, of which I have only received 2:5008$000 rs.; however, on this occasion I send you, through the conduct of our Superior Commanding Colonel, the following: in four suitcases of folded Bris — Silver by the value of the stamp Rs. 1:366$400 — 9 ounces of gold at nominal value, being 5 at 28$500 and 4 at 308 rs. each. In 5 boxes, marked — Almeida 50 fine ponchos 115 uniforms, being 74 crimson and 41 green 146 blue baize trousers 200 shirts\n\nThe rest of the money, which I will exchange, as well as the clothing being made, on Wednesday, the 18th of the present month, will accompany me in the direction of Pelotas, where I believe we will meet; in the suitcase marked X are the 9 ounces.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nPorto Alegre, May 14, 1836  \nDomingos José de Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Antônio de Sousa Neto  \nColonel Commander of the 1st Liberal Division"
