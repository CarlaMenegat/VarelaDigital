  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nSince I arrived here on the 5th of the current month, I have been diligently working to complete 350 jackets, as many pants and shirts, and 450 ponchos for this division, requisitioning 100 extra ponchos for my legion, being aware of its condition, etc.; and despite my efforts, I have obtained nothing, so to speak; the reason for this remains with me, so as not to stir up intrigues. I requisitioned six contos, which I was instructed to receive in copper, of which I have only received 2:5008$000 réis; but nonetheless I hereby send you on this occasion, through our Superior Commanding Colonel, the following: in four suitcases of folded Bris — Silver by the value of the stamp Rs. 1:366$400 — 9 ounces of gold by nominal value, being 5 at 28$500 and 4 at 308 réis each. In 5 boxes, marked — Almeida 50 fine ponchos 115 suits, being 74 crimson and 41 green 146 blue baize pants 200 shirts\n\nThe rest of the money, which I will exchange, as well as the clothes being made, on Wednesday, the 18th of this month, will follow me to the direction of Pelotas, where I believe we shall meet; in the suitcase marked X are the 9 ounces.\n\nGod keep Your Lordship  \nPorto Alegre, May 14, 1836  \nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Antônio de Sousa Neto  \nColonel Commanding of the 1st Liberal Division"
