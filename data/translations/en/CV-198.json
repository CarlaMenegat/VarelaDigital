  "translation": "Since I arrived here on the 5th of the current month, I have been diligently working to prepare 350 jackets, the same number of pants and shirts, and 450 ponchos for this division, requesting 100 more ponchos for my legion, knowing the state of it, etc.; and despite my efforts, I have obtained nothing, so to speak; the reason for this remains with me, so as not to ignite intrigues. I requested six thousand, which I was to be given in cash, of which I have only received 2:5008$000 rs.; however, I send you on this occasion, through the means of our Colonel Commander in Chief, the following: in four bags of Bris folded — Silver for the value of the mint Rs. 1:366$400 — 9 ounces of gold at face value, being 5 at 28$500 and 4 at 308 rs. each. In 5 boxes, marked — Almeida 50 fine ponchos 115 uniforms, being 74 crimson and 41 green 146 blue canvas pants 200 shirts.\n\nThe rest of the money, which I am exchanging, along with the clothing that is being made, will follow with me in the direction of Pelotas on Wednesday, the 18th of this month, where I believe we will meet; in the bag marked X is where the 9 ounces will go.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Antônio de Sousa Neto Colonel Commander of the 1st Liberal Division"
