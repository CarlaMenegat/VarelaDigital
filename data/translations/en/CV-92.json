  "translation": "I acknowledge receipt of your official letter dated the 7th, on the 9th of the current month; there is an old saying that better late than never; I was taken by surprise on the 8th by a force of 30 men, at eleven o'clock in the morning, and it was so fortunate that I did not lose a man except for a coward who ran away with five men he had; they were not very comfortable; they lost a shot horse and could not stay very long in the place, and if I had gathered all my men, I don't know how they would have managed to escape; they took about 16 horses and some bags of clothes and ponchos, two; the party was led by Juca Custódio and Farias, and after some time of discussion I went to speak with Juca Custódio, where I was with him for about an hour."
