  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your official letter dated the 7th, on the 9th of the current month; there is an old saying that it is better late than never; I was attacked by surprise on the 8th by a force of 30 men, at eleven o'clock in the day, and it was so fortunate that I lost only one man, a ruffian who defected along with five men he had; they were not very bold; they lost a horse shot and could not stay long in the place, and if I had all my people gathered, I do not know how they would have escaped; they took about 16 horses and some luggage of clothes and ponchos, two; the party was commanded by Juca Custódio and Farias, and after some time of discussion I went to speak with Juca Custódio, where I stayed for about an hour with him.\n\nThis is what I have to report to Your Most Illustrious Lordship Senhor Antônio Pedro de Abreu. Lieutenant and Commander of the Police of Triunfo. Paulo José de Abreu. Captain Commander of the Police of Santo Amaro.\n\nSeen and copy for the press."
