  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your official letter dated the 7th, on the 9th of the current month; there is an old saying that it is better late than never; I was taken by surprise on the 8th by a force of 30 men, at eleven o'clock in the day, and it was so fortunate that I lost only one man, a rascal who deserted along with five men he had; they were not very bold; they lost a horse that was shot and could not stop long in the place, and if I had had all my men gathered, I do not know how they would have escaped; they took about 16 horses and some suitcases of clothes and ponchos, two; the group was commanded by Juca Custódio and Farias, and after some time of discussion I spoke with Juca Custódio, where I stayed with him for about an hour.\n\nThis is what I have to report to Your Most Illustrious Lordship Antônio Pedro de Abreu. Lieutenant and Commander of the Police of Triunfo. Paulo José de Abreu. Captain Commander of the Police of Santo Amaro.\n\nSeen and copy for the press."
