  "translation": "Friend Inácio\n\nI have now obtained the adjoining permit and with it I sent the said gentleman to our friend Abreu, and that he passes by here so that I can write. When Inocêncio or the carts return, I will say what occurs about the flours.\n\nYour sincere friend and thank you Almeida \nPiratini, November 7, 1838."
