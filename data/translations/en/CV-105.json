  "translation": "Captain Hipólito with 30 men, including 3 subalterns, presented themselves in this camp on the 12th of the current month, being the only assistance that in 32 days, that I have been here, I have received from that insensible Province. It seems impossible, Excellency, that São Paulo, which has nearly 400,000 inhabitants, does not have means to assist us with the limited help of 1,000 men for the fortune of the South, and that everything depends on higher orders, and that in these excuses our time is wasted, until the enemy (who does not sleep) gathers from the most distant parts where they are and defeats us in our apathy. This place, Excellency, Lages, boasting of greater assistance, and even attempting the invasion of this Province. I do not believe that will happen, however, in light of what I observe, the lack of patriotism and no resources sent to date, I hardly doubt it. Excellency, Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency Brazil; Your Excellency Santa Catarina, I know nothing until now, although I have already written to Excellency Your Excellency Your Excellency.\n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho."
