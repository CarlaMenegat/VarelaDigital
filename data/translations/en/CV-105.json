  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nCamp this side of Canoas, February 14, 1840.\n\nCaptain Hipólito with 30 men, including 3 subordinates, presented themselves at this camp on the 12th of the current month, being the only aid that in 32 days, since I have been here, I have received from this insensitive Province. It seems impossible, Most Excellent Sir São Paulo, which has nearly 400,000 inhabitants, to have no means to assist us with the limited aid of 1,000 men for the fortune of the South, and that everything depends on superior orders, and that with these excuses our time is lost, until the enemy (who does not sleep) gathers from the most distant parts where they are found and strikes us in our apathy. This place, Most Excellent Sir Lages, boasting of greater aid, and even intending the invasion of this Province. I do not believe that such will happen, but, in view of what I observe, the lack of patriotism and no resource sent until now, I almost do not doubt it. Most Excellent Sir Most Excellent Your Excellency Your Excellency Brazil; Your Excellency Santa Catarina until now I know nothing, despite having already corresponded with Most Excellent Your Excellency Your Excellency.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency Antônio de Melo e Albuquerque, Colonel Commander of the Imperial Cruz-Altense Brigade.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João da Silva Machado, Superior Commander of the Legions of the Southern National Guard of the Province of São Paulo and of the Rio Negro and Lages Division.\n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho. A. Varela"
