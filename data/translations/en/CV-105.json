  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nCampo aquém de Canoas, February 14, 1840.\n\nCaptain Hipólito with 30 men, including 3 subordinates, presented themselves at this field on the 12th of the current month, being the only aid that in 32 days, that I have been here, I have received from this insensitive Province. It seems impossible, Most Excellent Sir São Paulo, which counts nearly 400,000 inhabitants, does not have the means to assist us with the limited help of 1,000 men for the fortune of the South, and that everything depends on higher orders, and that by these excuses time passes for us, until the enemy (who does not sleep) gathers from the most distant parts in which they find themselves and strikes us in our apathy. This place, Most Excellent Sir Lages, boasting of greater aid, and even intending the invasion of that Province. I do not believe that such will happen, however, in view of what I observe, the lack of patriotism and no resources sent until now, I almost do not doubt it. Most Excellent Sir Most Excellent Your Excellency Your Excellency Brazil; Your Excellency Santa Catarina until now I know nothing, despite having already communicated to Most Excellent Your Excellency Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Antônio de Melo e Albuquerque, Colonel Commander of the Imperial Cruz-altense Brigade.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João da Silva Machado, Superior Commander of the G.N. Legions of the South of the Province of São Paulo and of the Division of Rio Negro and Lages.\n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho. Alfredo Varela"
