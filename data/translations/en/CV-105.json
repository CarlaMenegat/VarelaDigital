  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nCampo aquém de Canoas, February 14, 1840.\n\nCaptain Hipólito with 30 men, including 3 subordinates, presented themselves in this field on the 12th of the current month, being the only aid that in 32 days, during which I have been here, I have received from this indifferent Province. It seems impossible, Most Excellent Sir São Paulo, which has nearly 400,000 inhabitants, does not have means to assist us with the limited aid of 1,000 men for the South's fortune, and that everything depends on higher orders, and that in these excuses our time passes, until the enemy (who does not sleep) assembles from the most distant parts where they are and strikes us in our apathy. This place, Most Excellent Sir Lages, boasting of greater aid, and even attempting the invasion of that Province. I do not believe that such will happen, however, in view of what I observe, the lack of patriotism and no resources sent so far, I almost do not doubt it. Most Excellent Sir, Most Excellent Your Excellency, Your Excellency Brazil; Your Excellency Santa Catarina, until now I know nothing, despite having already sent dispatches to the Most Excellent Your Excellency, Your Excellency.\n\nMay God guard Your Excellency.\nAntônio de Melo e Albuquerque,\nColonel Commander of the Imperial Brigada Cruz-altense.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João da Silva Machado,\nSuperior Commander of the Legions of G.N. of the South Province of São Paulo and of the Division of Rio Negro and Lages.\n\nDonated by the late Martim Francisco Filho. A. Varela"
