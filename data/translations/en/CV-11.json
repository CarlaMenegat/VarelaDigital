  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nThe citizen Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu, upon leaving this capital, informing me that Your Excellency [should record] Erval and Boqueirão, so that their importance may be found in what the State owes him, and for what he agreed with Your Excellency Alexandre Silveira Lopes to have the same destination, asked me to accept said documents from him, which I did.\n\nThe letter, copy, and official letter in numbers 1, 2, and 3 verify what I have expressed; and therefore, being surprised and overwhelmed by the requirement of a power of attorney for the registration of the liquidated debt of the said citizen, registration which I requested due to the approaching transfer of the seat of government, and because the account in question must be recorded in the Treasury for the transactions to be made should the promised settlement be verified, once again I request of Your Excellency Your Excellency\n\nDomingos José de Almeida  \nBagé, March 19, 1842\n\nAnnexed to document CV-10."
