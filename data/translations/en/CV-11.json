  "translation": "Most Illustrious Excellent Sir\n\nThe citizen Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu, upon departing from this capital, informing me that Your Excellency Erval and Boqueirão, for the importance of them to be found in what the State owes him, and for what he agreed with Your Excellency Alexandre Silveira Lopes to have the same destination, asked me to accept said documents, which I did.\n\nThe letter, copy, and official document in numbers 1, 2, and 3 verify what I have expressed; and therefore, being overwhelmed and surprised by the requirement of a power of attorney for the registration of the liquidated debt of the referred citizen, registration that I requested due to the approaching transfer of the seat of government, and the account in question must appear in the Treasury for transactions to be carried out should the promised payment be verified, once again I request from Your Excellency Your Excellency\n\nDomingos José de Almeida Bagé, March 19, 1842\n\nAttached to document CV-10."
