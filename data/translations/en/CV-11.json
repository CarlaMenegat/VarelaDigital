  "translation": "Citizen Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu, upon leaving this capital, informed me that Your Excellency Erval and Boqueirão, for the amounts due owed to him by the State, and for what was agreed with Your Excellency Alexandre Silveira Lopes to have the same destination, requested that I accept the aforementioned documents, which I did.\n\nThe letter, copy, and official documents numbered 1, 2, and 3 verify what I have expressed; and for this reason, being surprised by the demand for a power of attorney for the registration of the extinguished debt of the referred citizen, a registration that I requested as the transfer of the seat of government approaches, and must be included in the Treasury’s accounts in question for the transactions to be made in case the promised meeting takes place, once again I request of Your Excellency Your Excellency."
