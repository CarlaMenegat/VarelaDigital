  "translation": "Mr. Villa de Melo, August 11, 1841\n\nSir\n\nI have received your very esteemed letter dated the 6th of this month, and in responding to the Minister, I cannot help but tell him that, pleased by the honorable expressions of friendship with which the Minister has treated me even before knowing me, I must tell the Minister that here or at any post he can count on the friendship of a very republican Oriental.\n\nRegarding the horse that the Minister mentioned to me, you can be sure that I will look for it and send it to you as soon as possible.\n\nWithout further ado, send with the frankness you wish to your friend and Yours faithfully and well informed, Manuel de Aleman\n\nAnswered on August 19, 1841."
