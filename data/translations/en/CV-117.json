  "translation": "Mr. Villa de Melo, August 11, 1841\n\nSir\n\nI have taken note of your most appreciated letter of the 6th of the current month and, in responding to the Minister, I cannot help but tell him that, grateful for the honorable expressions of friendship with which the Minister has treated me even before knowing me, I must tell the Minister that here or at any post he must count on the friendship of a very republican Oriental.\n\nRegarding the horse the Minister mentions to me, you may be sure that I will look for it and that I shall send it to you as soon as possible.\n\nWithout further ado, command with the frankness you please your friend and yours faithfully,  \nManuel de Aleman\n\nAnswered August 19, 1841."
