  "translation": "Sir,\n\nI am informed of your very appreciated date of the 6th of this month, and in responding to the Minister, I cannot help but say that, thankful for the honorable expressions of friendship with which the Minister has treated me since before we met, I must tell the Minister that here or at any destination, he can count on the friendship of a very republican Oriental.\n\nRegarding the horse that the Minister mentioned to me, rest assured that I will look for it and send it to him as soon as possible."
