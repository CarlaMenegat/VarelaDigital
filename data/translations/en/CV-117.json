  "translation": "Mr. Villa de Melo, August 11, 1841\n\nSir\n\nI have received your most appreciated letter dated the 6th of the current month and in responding to the Minister, I cannot but say that, pleased with the honorable expressions of friendship with which the Minister has treated me even before knowing me, I must tell the Minister that here or in any post he can count on the friendship of a very republican Oriental.\n\nRegarding the horse the Minister mentions to me, you may be assured that I will look for it and will send it to you as soon as possible.\n\nNothing more, send with the frankness you wish to your friend and Yours Faithfully and Well Informed Manuel de Aleman\n\nAnswered August 19, 1841."
