  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, March 30, 1838.\n\nHaving only written what is above to dispatch the Sir to there, I receive your letter of the 28th of this month and another from the godfather with the same date: thus I am pleased with the state of health of our children, yet tears came to my eyes at the position of your brother.\n\nGod so wills it, we must respect His decrees. Last night, without expecting it, I received the appointment to once again occupy the place I had left: judge for yourself how much this incident must have troubled me! I have already pledged my friendship and services to the President and the Republic to be excused from such a post; nothing has been granted to me; yet I will still make myself firm until you tell me what I should do about it: for although I see my adversaries faltering, and the slanders they cast upon me disproved, still my repugnance is invincible.\n\nBy the mulatto I will send you all that you commission me, as well as what your father asks, whom you will comfort to receive with resignation the blow that heaven prepares for him.\n\nI will value that our children do not suffer danger, especially Bruto, whose loss would put me in despair: hugs to all, longing for your father, mother, and brothers, and receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nMadam. Feliz Retiro."
