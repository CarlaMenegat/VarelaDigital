  "translation": "Having only written what is seen above, to dispatch the Lord for that, I receive your letter of the 28th of this month and another from compadre with the same date: I am therefore glad about the state of health of our children; however, tears came to my eyes at the position of your brother.\n\nGod wills it so; we must respect His decrees. Last night, unexpectedly, I received the appointment to once again occupy the position I had left: consider how much this incident must have troubled me! I have already committed my friendship and services to the President and the Republic to be excused from such a position; nothing has been done for me; however, I will remain strong until you tell me what I ought to do about it: for despite seeing my adversaries falter and the slanders that they hurled at me being disproved, my aversion is nonetheless unyielding.\n\nI will send you everything you have asked for through the mulatto, as well as what your father requests, whom you will comfort, so that he may receive with resignation the blow that heaven has prepared for him."
