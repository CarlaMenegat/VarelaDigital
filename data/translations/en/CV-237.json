  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, March 30, 1838.\n\nHaving only written what is seen above, to dispatch the Senhor to that place, I receive your letter of the 28th of the current month and another from the compadre with the same date: I am therefore pleased by the state of health of our children, yet tears came to my eyes at your brother’s condition.\n\nGod wills it so, we must respect His decrees. Last night, without expecting it, the appointment to again occupy the place I had left came into my hands: judge for yourself how much this incident must have troubled me! I have already pledged my friendship and services to the President and the Republic to be excused from such an office; nothing has been granted to me; however, I will still be obstinate until you tell me what I should do regarding this: for despite seeing my adversaries faltering, and the slanders they cast upon me disproved, nonetheless my repugnance is invincible.\n\nFor the mulatto, I will send everything you commission me, as well as what your father requests, whom you will comfort, to receive with resignation the blow that heaven prepares for him.\n\nI will cherish that our children are not in danger, especially Bruto, whose loss would plunge me into despair: embraces to all, regards to your father, mother, and siblings, and receive the heart of Almeida.\n\nMadam. Feliz Retiro."
