  "translation": "In compliance with the orders of Your Excellency Provisório and 29 of the 5th Company of Cavalry of the Squadron of Barra under my command, embarked on the yacht \"Ventura Feliz\" of Captain João Antônio and accompanied by the war sloop under the command of Lieutenant José Ricardo to the coast of Lagoa dos Patos, in the place of Tapes, where I arrived on the morning of the 6th; and following my details, I soon apprehended a watchman from the anarchist police, in which imprisonment two perished for resisting, both being among the most villainous. I immediately seized the yacht São Manuel, belonging to the rebel João Antônio Lopes, loaded with mate herb, ready to set sail, which for the third time was there with a large supply for the anarchists, as well as other loads that were still on land for loading onto another yacht, as well as more ensurroada herb and skins. Furthermore, that same day, I ventured horses and set out at night with 30 men to the chapel of Dores to apprehend certain highly valued anarchists; however, being anticipated when horses were taken by a certain Chico Rocha, who like a flash was able to warn and alert his ragged colleagues, when at midnight I surrounded their houses they were all already in the brush, finding myself alone with the families.\n\nHowever, central to a distance of three and a half leagues, in the location of Miguel Barbosa, I took a bronze piece with its repairs, which had been taken from the barge of Legalidade nova in Rio Pardo on the 30th of April of this current year, which was en route to the river of Camaquã, where it is said a squadron of rebels is preparing. After transporting and embarking this piece, and everything else I seized, fearing some ambush suddenly, I ordered that some troops be embarked, and while almost two-thirds were embarked and having already released the horses, I was impulsively attacked by a force of more than 50 enemy men, and thus with that little number of people, I faced them, in such a position that the anarchists after firing their first shot in their fury and receiving another from the lawful forces and more shots from the rear, where they did not expect, became entangled with one another; and at that moment, 4 shots of flat ball from the cannon boat were well sent, which contributed to the rebels leaving the field; knowing well that some were injured, and the said informer Chico Rocha escaped on foot among the other ragged, leaving the shot and dead horse with its harness, and no one from the lawful side, thanks to divine providence, was injured. After this, I embarked with the rest of the men on the same day, the 7th of the current month, immediately sending the vessels to this capital where they are anchored, taking nearly 8 days on the return due to lack of wind. The said rebel João Antônio Lopes was seized the yacht São Manuel, two blacks who were on it, 1500 arrobas of ensurroada mate herb, Your Excellency."
