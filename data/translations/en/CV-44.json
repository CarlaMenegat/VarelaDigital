  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nIn compliance with the orders of Your Excellency, I, Provisório, and the 29th of the 5th Cavalry Company of the Esquadrão da Barra under my command, embarked on the yacht “Ventura Feliz” of Captain João Antônio and accompanied by the war schooner under the command of Lieutenant José Ricardo to the coast of Lagoa dos Patos, at the place called Tapes, where I arrived at dawn on the 6th; and following my instructions, I immediately arrested a vigilante anarchist police, in which arrest two perished, resisting, both being among the worst malefactors. I immediately seized the yacht São Manuel, of the rebel João Antônio Lopes, loaded with mate herb, ready to set sail, which for the third time was bringing a large supply to the anarchists, as well as other cargoes still on land intended to be loaded onto another yacht, as well as more pressed herb and leather. Moreover, on the same day, I managed to seize horses and depart by night with 30 men to the Chapel of Sorrows to arrest certain highly notable anarchists, but being forewarned when horses were being seized by a certain Chico Rocha, who like lightning was able to warn and send warnings everywhere to his ragtag colleagues, so that by midnight when I surrounded their houses, they were all already in the bush, and I found myself alone with the families.\n\nHowever, centrally at a distance of three and a half leagues, at the site of Miguel Barbosa, I took a bronze piece with its fittings, which had been taken from the barge of the New Legality in Rio Pardo on April 30 of the current year, which was en route to the Camaquã river, where it is said a squadron of the rebels is being prepared. After taking and embarking this piece, and all else that I seized, fearing a sudden ambush, I ordered some soldiers to embark, and with almost two thirds already embarked and the horses already released, I was suddenly attacked by a force of more than 50 enemy men, and nevertheless on foot, with that small number I faced them in such a position that the anarchists, after firing their first discharge under their fury and receiving another from the loyalists and some shots from the rear where they did not expect them, were thrown into confusion over each other; and on this occasion, four shots from the smoothbore cannon of the gunboat were well directed at them, which contributed to the rebels leaving the field; it was clear that some were wounded, and the informant Chico Rocha escaped on foot through among the most ragged, leaving the horse shot and dead with saddlery, and among the loyalists, thanks to divine providence, no one was injured. After this, I embarked with the rest of the men on the same day, the 7th of the current month, immediately sending the vessels to this capital where they are now anchored, taking nearly 8 days on the return due to lack of wind. Seized from the said rebel João Antônio Lopes were the yacht São Manuel, two blacks who were aboard it, 1,500 arrobas of pressed mate herb, Your Excellency.\n\nBarracks in Porto Alegre, July 16, 1838.  \nMost Excellent Sir Francisco Xavier da Cunha  \nBrigadier Commander of the Garrison of this capital  \nPorto Alegre  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nCaptain"
