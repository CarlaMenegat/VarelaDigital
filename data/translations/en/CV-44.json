  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn compliance with the orders of Your Excellency, I, Provisory and commander of the 29th of the 5th Cavalry Company of the Barra Squadron, embarked on the yacht “Ventura Feliz” of Captain João Antônio and accompanied by the war schooner under the command of Lieutenant José Ricardo towards the coast of Lagoa dos Patos, at the place called Tapes, where I arrived on the 6th, at dawn; and following my details, I soon arrested an anarchist vigil policeman, in which arrest two perished, due to resistance, both being among the most wicked. I immediately seized the yacht São Manuel, of the rebel João Antônio Lopes, loaded with yerba mate, ready to continue its voyage, which for the third time was going there with a large supply for the anarchists, as well as other cargoes that he still had on land to load onto another yacht, as well as more yerba mate pressed and hides. Furthermore, on the same day, I ventured horses and traveled by night with 30 men to the Chapel of Sorrows to arrest certain highly endorsed anarchists, but being forewarned when horses were seized by a certain Chico Rocha, who like lightning was able to warn and send warnings everywhere to his ragged colleagues, that when I surrounded their houses at midnight they were already all in the woods, leaving me only with the families.\n\nHowever, centrally at a distance of three and a half leagues, at the place called Miguel Barbosa, I took a bronze piece with its fittings, which had been taken from the barge of the New Legality in Rio Pardo on April 30th of the current year, which was en route to the river Camaquã, where they say a squadron of the rebels is being prepared. After towing and embarking this piece, and everything else I seized, fearing some sudden ambush, I ordered some troops to embark, and when nearly two-thirds were already embarked and the horses had been released, I was abruptly attacked by a force of more than 50 enemy men, and still on foot, with that few men, I faced them, in such a position that the anarchists, after giving the first discharge under their fury and receiving another shot from the loyalists and some more shots from the rear, from which they did not expect, swirled over one another; and on this occasion, four shots from the shallow-ball piece of the gunboat were well aimed at them, which contributed to the rebels leaving the field; it was well known that some were wounded, and the said informant Chico Rocha escaped on foot among the ragged, leaving the horse shot and dead with tack, and among the loyalists, thanks to divine providence, no one was injured. After this, I embarked with the remaining men on the same day, the 7th of the current month, immediately departing with the boats for this capital where they are anchored, spending nearly eight days on the return, due to lack of wind. The said rebel João Antônio Lopes had seized from him the yacht São Manuel, two black men who were with him on the yacht, 1,500 arrobas of pressed yerba mate, Your Excellency.\n\nBarracks at Porto Alegre, July 16, 1838.\n\nMost Excellent Sir Francisco Xavier da Cunha,\nBrigadier Commander of the Garrison of this capital,\nPorto Alegre,\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu,\nCaptain"
