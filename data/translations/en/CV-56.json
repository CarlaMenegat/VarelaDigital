All the officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers who accompanied me conducted themselves with great activity, subordination and valor, distinguishing themselves primarily Lieutenant Isaías, Ensign Carvalho and Corporal Fidélis Pais da Silva.\n\nIt is also very praiseworthy the activity of Navy Lieutenant Rocha, and through him all the rest of the navy that accompanied me. I shall not be more extensive because Your Excellency—Your Excellency Porto Alegre, September 21, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Filipe Neri de Oliveira, Brigadier and Commander of the Brigade. Francisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nDeath of Colonel José Manuel de Leão."
