  "translation": "On the 17th of the current month, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I left this city with 90 cavalrymen and over 60 infantrymen, German volunteers, embarked on two boats and two lanchões; and facing the islands, according to orders, I was joined by the 3rd boat, with over 40 horses and 3 war lanchões commanded by Lieutenant of the Navy Rocha; and following everything under my command, I made a landing on the 18th, at 4 o'clock in the early morning, in Santa Cruz; and from there I marched, with 40 cavalrymen on horseback and the aforementioned infantry commanded by Captain Christe, a distance of one league along the coast of the Arroio dos Ratos, where I ordered a false path to be made, and with considerable difficulty, I passed the men with two canoes that I had sent to tow the horse saddles.\n\nAnd upon completing the crossing, I divided the men and ordered various points to be surrounded, with the rebel guard at the mouth of the Arroio dos Ratos, the chacra of Leão and his charqueada; and being fortunate in all areas, seven rebels were killed, among whom were Colonel of the Legion José Manuel de Leão and the assassin Antônio Turpim, and 9 were taken prisoner, including Lieutenant Jerônimo and Ensign Inocêncio, over a hundred horses and over a hundred cattle, including many tame oxen, some weapons, and over a hundred packaged cartridges, one arroba of lead number B and seven bundles of white-handled knives, with each bundle containing 25 knives; which, cartridges, lead, knives, and 43 hides in hair, I delivered to the aforementioned Lieutenant Rocha.\n\nWith the arrival of Your Excellency Leão, with Battalion 8, I followed the orders of Your Excellency Ponta Rasa, and the other horses on the island of the Detachment, and a boat of cattle and tame oxen to this capital. All the officers and junior officers and soldiers who accompanied me behaved with great activity, subordination, and valor, with Lieutenant Isaías, Ensign Carvalho, and Corporal Fidélis Pais da Silva standing out in particular.\n\nAlso much commendable was the activity of Lieutenant of the Navy Rocha, and all the rest of the navy that accompanied me. I will not write more extensively because Your Excellency Porto Alegre, September 21, 1839."
