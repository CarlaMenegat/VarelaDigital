All the officers, subordinate officers, and soldiers who accompanied me conducted themselves with great activity, subordination, and valor, distinctly standing out were Lieutenant Isaías, Ensign Carvalho, and Corporal Fidélis Pais da Silva.\n\nThe activity of Naval Lieutenant Rocha is also much to be praised, as well as that of all the other navy men who accompanied me. I shall not be more lengthy because Your Excellency...\n\nPorto Alegre, September 21, 1839.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Filipe Neri de Oliveira, Brigadier and Commander of the Brigade.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu.\n\nDeath of Colonel José Manuel de Leão."
