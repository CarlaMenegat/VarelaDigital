  "translation": "I already know that you are at Señor Ramirez's farm called Palmar, near Señor Manuel Gonçalves, about two leagues away.\n\nIt seemed to me that you should head towards Durazno, in order to keep yourself away from the contact with our enemies who inhabit the areas near the border; however, to spare you discomfort, I appreciate your decision. Do as soon as possible what I recommended through compadre José Félix, being able to divide the task among various people, and deriving some usefulness from it in wages, even if they are small. For this, I am sending you a power of attorney. Send these letters to prevent yourself, and entrust the collection of Jaime Legris to Señor Manuel Gonçalves, always keeping the carts and oxen in travel mode so that you will have them covered. Colonel João Antônio engaged the enemy near São Gabriel, whom he completely defeated, as only 16 men survived; and today independence of this State has been proclaimed here, for which I congratulate you and our children for whom I work.\n\nI do not know about your parents and I have therefore been anxious, as I was told that compadre fell ill on the third day of the journey; if you have the means to take care of him, urge him to come to your company and be diligent in his recovery. Lima has worsened, and I believe the swelling he had in his face is worsening. Do not have the slightest worry about me because I work, and no discomfort will weigh on someone who serves the homeland and freedom wholeheartedly."
