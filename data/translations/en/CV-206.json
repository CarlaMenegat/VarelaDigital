  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, November 6, 1836, at 7 in the evening.\n\nI already know that you are at Senhor Ramirez’s estate called Palmar, near Senhor Manuel Gonçalves, about two leagues away.\n\nIt seemed to me that you should go to Durazno, in order to place yourself far from the contact of our enemies living near the border; but to save you trouble, I respect your decision. Do as soon as possible what I recommended to you through compadre José Félix, being able to divide the matter among several people, and even gaining some utility from it in wages, however small they may be, for which I send you a power of attorney. Send these letters so that you can prepare yourself, and entrust the collection from Jaime Legris to the same Senhor Manuel Gonçalves, always keeping the carts and oxen ready for travel so that you can order them to be covered. Colonel João Antônio gave an action to the enemy near São Gabriel, whom he completely defeated, as only 16 men survived; and today independence of this State was proclaimed here, for which I congratulate you and our children for whom I work.\n\nI do not know about your parents and have therefore lived anxious because I was told that the compadre fell ill on the 3rd day of the journey; if there you have means to care for him, urge him to come to your company and devote yourself to his recovery. Lima has worsened and I believe the swelling he had on his face is coming to a boil. You must not have the least worry about me because I work, and no trouble will be weighed on those who serve the homeland and freedom from the heart.\n\nHugs to our children, regards to compadre José Félix, to whom you will say that Senhor José Pedro is well, and receive you the heart of Your faithful Almeida.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Estado Oriental. Taquari."
