  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, November 6, 1836, at 7 o’clock in the evening.\n\nI already know that you are at the estate of Senhor Ramirez called Palmar, near Senhor Manuel Gonçalves, about two leagues away.\n\nIt seemed to me that you should go to Durazno, in order to put yourself far from the contact of our enemies who inhabit the vicinity of the border; but to spare you inconvenience, I esteem your resolution. Do as soon as possible what I recommended to you through godfather José Félix, being able to divide the matter among several people, and taking from that some utility in wages even if small, for which I send you a power of attorney. Send these letters to prepare yourself, and entrust the collection of Jaime Legris to the same Senhor Manuel Gonçalves, always keeping the carts and oxen ready for travel for which you will send to cover them. Colonel João Antônio gave an action to the enemy near São Gabriel, whom he completely defeated, for only 16 men survived; and today the independence of this State was proclaimed here, for which I congratulate you and our children for whom I work.\n\nI do not know about your parents and have therefore lived distressed because I was told that the godfather became ill on the 3rd day of the journey; if you have the means to treat him there, urge him to come to your company and devote yourself to his recovery. Lima has worsened and I believe the swelling he had on his face has come to a boil. Do not have the slightest worry about me because I work, and no inconvenience will be heavy to one who serves the homeland and liberty with heart.\n\nHugs to our children, regards to godfather José Félix, to whom you will say that Senhor José Pedro is well, and receive yourself the heart of Your faithful Almeida.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Estado Oriental. Taquari."
