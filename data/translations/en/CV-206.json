  "translation": "Dear Bernardina Piratini, November 6, 1836, at 7 in the evening.\n\nI already know that you are at Senhor Ramirez's farm called Palmar, near Senhor Manuel Gonçalves, about two leagues away.\n\nIt seemed to me that you should go to Durazno, in order to put yourself far from the contact of our enemies living near the border; but to spare you trouble, I appreciate your decision. Do as soon as possible what I recommended to you through godfather José Félix, possibly dividing the matter among several people, and deriving some benefit from it in wages even if small, for which I send you a power of attorney. Send those letters to forewarn you, and entrust the collection from Jaime Legris to the same Senhor Manuel Gonçalves, always keeping the carts and oxen ready for travel so that you can cover them when ordered. Colonel João Antônio gave the enemy a fight near São Gabriel, whom he completely defeated, as only 16 men remained alive; and today independence was proclaimed here of this State, for which I congratulate you and our children for whom I work.\n\nI do not know about your parents and have therefore been living anxious since I was told that the godfather fell ill on the 3rd day of travel; if you have means there to treat him, urge him to come to your company and devote yourself to his recovery. Lima has worsened, and I believe the swelling he had on his face is turning into a abscess. Do not have the slightest worry about me because I am working, and no trouble will be heavy to those who serve the fatherland and liberty with heart.\n\nHugs to our children, regards to godfather José Félix, to whom you will say Senhor José Pedro is getting better, and receive you the heart of Your faithful Almeida.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Oriental State. Taquari."
