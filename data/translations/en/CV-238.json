  "translation": "State Secretariat of the Treasury Affairs, Piratini, April 5, 1838.\n\nAs it must be put into effective progress according to the decrees of November 11, 1836, and April 5, 1837, not only to put into collection the goods abandoned by the enemy, which, through an inconceivable apathy or criminal indolence, have been left to the destructive hands of time and immoral men, who, in excesses of misunderstood patriotism, overthrow capitals that immense labors and praiseworthy economies have accumulated; but also to secure for the State the product of these goods, or for the innocent children of the country, who, because of the deeds of their parents, should not be deprived of the care of a nation that acknowledges the principles of justice and bases its conduct upon them; and likewise so that such products, suitably applied, may serve to alleviate the privations of the citizens who are armed and of their families, the government determines that Your Excellency\n\n- 1. The owners, whether they, by siding with the enemy, waged war against us, or if when the war ignited in January 1836 they were already in an occupied place without means to flee;\n- 2. Whether they are married and have children, and if these exist in the management of the houses or in the Army;\n- 3. What portion of land, more or less, each property comprises, what buildings or factories there are on them, and approximately how many cattle, horses, and sheep; how many slaves, their sexes, ages, and trades;\n- 4. Finally, the estimated value of said properties, their furniture, and utensils.\n\nEqual reports are required from the nationals themselves. The government recommends their patriotism to the prompt progress of this order, immediately removing any obstacle that opposes it, being able, to carry out such an important service, to call to their aid persons of integrity and competence deemed necessary, without however diminishing army ranks.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency.  \nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nLetter from Domingos José de Almeida, April 5, received on May 1. (Written by Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães)"
