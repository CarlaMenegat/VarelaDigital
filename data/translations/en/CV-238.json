  "translation": "Secretary of State for the Treasury Affairs, Piratini, April 5, 1838.\n\nIn order to effectively implement what is stipulated by the decrees of November 11, 1836, and April 5, 1837, not only to commence the collection of assets abandoned by the enemy, which through an inconceivable apathy or criminal negligence have been left to the destructive hand of time and immoral men, who, in the excesses of misunderstood patriotism, topple capitals that immense labors and praiseworthy economies have accumulated; but also to secure for the State the product of these assets, or for the innocent children of the country, who by the deeds of their parents should not be deprived of the care of a nation that recognizes the principles of justice and bases its conduct upon them, and likewise so that such products, properly applied, serve to alleviate the hardships of the citizens who are in arms, and of their families, the government orders Your Excellency to\n\n- 1. determine which are the owners, whether they having sided with the enemy made war upon us, or if, when it ignited in January 1836, they were already in an occupied place and without means of escape;\n- 2. whether they are married and have children, and if these exist in the management of the estates, or in the Army;\n- 3. what approximate portion of land more or less composes each of the properties, what buildings or factories exist on them, and approximately how many cattle, horses, and sheep; how many slaves, their sexes, ages, and trades;\n- 4. finally, the estimated value of said properties, their furniture, and utensils.\n\nSimilar reports are required from the nationals themselves. The government entrusts to their patriotism the prompt execution of this order, promptly removing any obstacle opposing it, and may, to carry out such an important task, call to their aid persons of probity and aptitude deemed necessary, without, however, weakening military posts.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency Domingos José de Almeida\n\nOfficial letter from Domingos José de Almeida, April 5, received on May 1. (Handwriting by Inácio José de Oliveira Guimarães)"
