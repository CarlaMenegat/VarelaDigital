  "translation": "Given that action must be taken regarding the decrees of November 11, 1836, and April 5, 1837, not only to collect the goods abandoned by the enemy, which have been left to the destructive hand of time and immoral men due to inconceivable apathy or criminal indolence, and which, in the excesses of misunderstood patriotism, have toppled capital accumulated through immense and commendable efforts and savings; but also to ensure that the State receives the proceeds from these goods, or that the innocent children of the country, who should not be deprived of the support of a nation that recognizes the principles of justice and bases its conduct upon them due to the actions of their parents, are not neglected. Furthermore, it is determined that such proceeds, when appropriately applied, shall help alleviate the hardships faced by citizens who are armed and their families, the government commands that Your Honor\n\nIdentical relationships are required from the nationals themselves. The government recommends to their patriotism the prompt execution of this order, swiftly removing any obstacle that opposes it, and to carry out such an important service, may call upon individuals of integrity and aptitude that they deem necessary, without, however, detracting from the ranks of the army."
