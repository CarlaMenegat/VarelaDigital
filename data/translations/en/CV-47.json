  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nIn accordance with the orders of Your Excellency dated the 4th of the current month, at midnight, I embarked on 4 yachts and two gunboats and 5 war barges, with 60 cavalrymen of the squadron under my command, plus 24 cavalrymen of Manuel Bento, making 84 cavalrymen, and the officers of the same squadron, Captain Marianito Martins, Captain Vitor Neves, Lieutenant Paulo José de Abreu, Ensign Joaquim Rodrigues Jaques, Ensign Godinho and other cavalry officers who volunteered, as well as Major José Joaquim Neves, Captain José Inácio Ourives, Captain José Garcia, Lieutenant Demétrio Garcia, Ensign Manuel da Costa Guimarães, Ensign Ferreira and other individuals, as well as Esteves and Rocha, and 450 infantry and artillery troops with their officers, all under the orders of Senhor Salustiano, with the purpose of seizing a number of important carts that the rebel Bento Manuel Ribeiro had sent to cross the Rio do Caí, en route to Piratini. Upon arriving on the 5th at 10 o’clock in the morning at Ponta Rasa, where the landing was planned, news was received that the carts had already passed; thus, the expedition proceeded to the town of Triunfo, and by order of Senhor Salustiano, on the 6th at 6 in the morning, the cavalry and 170 infantrymen disembarked half a league below the town, and the town was besieged by land and sea, and upon closing the siege, a force of about 40 men, led by José de Almeida, was withdrawing from the town, which, when pursued by the cavalry, was completely defeated at Volta do Sabino, where 8 rebels were killed and 6 captured, and others, leaving their horses, threw themselves into the sea; of our men only two soldiers were slightly wounded, one under the chin and another in the hand, and with a sword.\n\nIn our possession after the engagement were 150 horses and 20 tame oxen belonging to the enemy, after which I withdrew to the town, where 20 barrels of aguardente that the rebels had stored en route to Piratini were seized, as well as a quantity of manioc flour; and since the carts had already passed the Taquari pass on the 4th of the current month, on the 6th I crossed with the cavalry to the other side of the town, and on the 7th, between Juca Leão’s charqueada and Arroio dos Ratos, I demolished a rebel party, leaving 6 or 7 killed and two severely wounded prisoners, and among the dead was also the notorious murderer Eusébio, foreman of Juca Leão. On both this and the other campaign at Volta do Sabino, all the cavalry behaved with remarkable valor, and much praise is due to the enthusiasm and courage of the aforementioned officers, who all were eager to advance first, and likewise the privates who, armed and mounted—\n\nAt Arroio dos Ratos Senhor Salustiano disembarked with over 300 infantrymen and joined the cavalry under my command; and we marched by land, both to engage Amaral Ferrador, should he be found, and to gather and drive some livestock for the supply of the troops, as well as for the hospitals and the town’s population; and not finding the rebel forces of Amaral Ferrador, we gathered over 300 head of cattle from the rebels’ lands, and with them we entered the Picada on the 9th of the current month with all the cavalry taken from the enemy, thus on said day in the camp at Picada the entire expedition by sea and land gathered without the loss of a single man.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency Camp at Picada, November 9, 1838. Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir Tomás José da Silva. Francisco Pedro de Abreu, Major."
