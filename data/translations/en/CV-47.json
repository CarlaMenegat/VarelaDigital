  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn accordance with the orders of Your Excellency on the 4th of the current month, at midnight, I embarked on 4 yachts and two gunboats and 5 war launches, with 60 cavalrymen from the squadron under my command, plus 24 men from Manuel Bento, making 84 cavalrymen, and the officers of the same squadron, Captain Marianito Martins, Captain Vitor Neves, Lieutenant Paulo José de Abreu, Ensign Joaquim Rodrigues Jaques, Ensign Godinho and other cavalry officers who voluntarily offered themselves, as well as Major José Joaquim Neves, Captain José Inácio Ourives, Captain José Garcia, Lieutenant Demétrio Garcia, Ensign Manuel da Costa Guimarães, Ensign Ferreira and other gentlemen, as well as Esteves and Rocha, and 450 men of infantry and artillery with their officers, all under the orders of Senhor Salustiano, with the aim of capturing a number of important wagons that the rebel Bento Manuel Ribeiro had sent across the Caí river, heading towards Piratini. Arriving at this expedition on the 5th, at 10 o'clock in the morning, at Ponta Rasa, where the landing was planned, we received news that the wagons had already passed; thus the expedition proceeded to the town of Triunfo and, by order of Senhor Salustiano, on the 6th, at 6 o'clock in the morning, landed half a league below the town the cavalry and 170 infantrymen, and the town was besieged by land and sea. At the closing of the siege, a force of over forty men under José de Almeida attempted to slip away from the town, which, being pursued by the cavalry, was completely defeated at Volta do Sabino, where among the rebels 8 were killed and 6 captured, and others, leaving their horses, threw themselves into the sea; among our forces, only two soldiers were lightly wounded, one under the chin and another in the hand, both with swords.\n\nWe captured 150 horses and 20 tame oxen from the enemy, after which I retired to the town, where 20 pipes of aguardente that the rebels had in deposit to be sent to Piratini were confiscated, as well as a quantity of manioc flour; and since the wagons had already passed the Taquari pass on the 4th of the current month, on the 6th I crossed with the cavalry to the other side of the town, and on the 7th, between Juca Leão’s charqueada and the Ratos stream, I had a rebel party smashed, leaving 6 or 7 dead and two seriously wounded captives, and among the dead was also the notorious assassin Eusébio, foreman of Juca Leão. In both this and the other action at Volta do Sabino, all the cavalrymen behaved with remarkable valor, and much praise is due for the good will and courage of the aforementioned officers, all eager to advance first, as well as the gentlemen who, armed and mounted, Señor Salustiano disembarked at arroio dos Ratos with over 300 infantrymen and joined the cavalry of my command; and we marched by land, not only to confront Amaral Ferrador, should he be found, but also to collect and lead some cattle for supply to the troops, the hospitals, and the people of the city; and not finding the rebel force of Amaral Ferrador, we assembled over 300 cattle from the rebel fields, and with these we entered Picada on the 9th of the current month with all the aforementioned cavalry captured from the enemy, thus reuniting on the said day at the camp of Picada the entire expedition by sea and land, without the loss of a single man.\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency.  \nCamp of Picada, November 9, 1838.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Tomás José da Silva.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Major."
