  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nAccording to Your Excellency's orders on the 4th of the current month, at midnight, I embarked on 4 yachts, two gunboats, and 5 war barges, with 60 cavalrymen from the squadron under my command, along with 24 men from Manuel Bento, making a total of 84 cavalrymen, and the officers of the same squadron: Captain Marianito Martins, Captain Vitor Neves, Lieutenant Paulo José de Abreu, Ensign Joaquim Rodrigues Jaques, Ensign Godinho, and other cavalry officers who volunteered, as well as Major José Joaquim Neves, Captain José Inácio Ourives, Captain José Garcia, Lieutenant Demétrio Garcia, Ensign Manuel da Costa Guimarães, Ensign Ferreira, and other civilians, including Esteves and Rocha, along with 450 infantry and artillerymen with their officers, all under the command of Senhor Salustiano, with the aim of capturing a number of important carts that the rebel Bento Manuel Ribeiro had sent across the Caí River, heading towards Piratini.\n\nThis expedition arrived on the 5th, at 10 o’clock in the morning, at Ponta Rasa, where the landing was planned. There they received news that the carts had already passed; thus, the expedition proceeded to the town of Triunfo and, by order of Senhor Salustiano, on the 6th, at 6 o’clock in the morning, disembarked a cavalry force and 170 infantrymen half a league below the town. The town was then surrounded by land and sea, and upon closing the siege, a force of over 40 men under José de Almeida attempted to escape. Pursuing him with the cavalry, he was completely defeated at Volta do Sabino, where among the rebels 8 were killed and 6 taken prisoner, while others, abandoning their horses, threw themselves into the sea. On our side, only two soldiers were slightly wounded: one below the chin and another on the hand, both by sword.\n\nWe captured from the enemy 150 horses and 20 docile oxen. Afterwards, I withdrew to the town, where 20 barrels of aguardente, which the rebels had stored to send to Piratini, were seized, as well as a large quantity of manioc flour. Since the carts had already crossed the Taquari Pass on the 4th of the current month, on the 6th, I crossed with the cavalry to the other side of the town. On the 7th, between Juca Leão’s charqueada and Arroio dos Ratos, I destroyed a group of rebels, leaving 6 or 7 dead and two seriously wounded prisoners, among the dead being the notorious assassin Eusébio, foreman of Juca Leão. In both this operation and the one at Volta do Sabino, all cavalrymen behaved with marked valor, and great commendation is due to the willingness and courage of the already mentioned officers, who were all eager to advance first, as well as the civilians mounted and armed.\n\nAt Arroio dos Ratos, Senhor Salustiano disembarked with over 300 infantrymen and joined the cavalry under my command; we marched by land, not only to attack Amaral Ferrador, should he be found, but also to gather and bring in some cattle for the supply of the troops, as well as the hospitals and the city's population. Not finding the rebel force of Amaral Ferrador, we gathered over 300 heads of cattle from the rebels' fields, and with them entered the Picada on the 9th of the current month, along with all of the aforementioned cavalry taken from the enemy. Thus, on that day the entire expedition by sea and land reunited at the Picada camp, without the loss of a single man.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.\n\nPicada Camp, November 9, 1838.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Tomás José da Silva.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Major."
