  "translation": "According to the orders of Your Excellency on the 4th of the current month, at midnight, I embarked on 4 yachts, 2 gunboats, and 5 war launches, with 60 men from the cavalry squadron under my command, along with 24 men from Manuel Bento, making a total of 84 cavalry, and the officers of the same squadron, Captain Marianito Martins, Captain Vitor Neves, Lieutenant Paulo José de Abreu, Ensign Joaquim Rodrigues Jaques, Ensign Godinho, and other cavalry officers who voluntarily offered themselves, along with Major José Joaquim Neves, Captain José Inácio Ourives, Captain José Garcia, Lieutenant Demétrio Garcia, Ensign Manuel da Costa Guimarães, Ensign Ferreira, and other individuals, as well as Esteves and Rocha, and 450 men from infantry and artillery with their officers, all under the orders of Mr. Salustiano, in order to seize a number of important wagons that the rebel Bento Manuel Ribeiro had sent across the river of Caí, heading for Piratini. \n\nUpon the expedition's arrival on the 5th, at 10 o'clock in the morning, at Ponta Rasa, where we had designated our disembarkation, we learned that the wagons had already left; thus, the expedition proceeded to the town of Triunfo and, by order of Mr. Salustiano, on the 6th, at 6 o'clock in the morning, disembarked, half a league below the town, the cavalry and 170 men of infantry, and surrounded the town by land and sea. As we closed in, a force of about 40 men, led by José de Almeida, tried to escape from the town; pursuing him with the cavalry, he was completely defeated at Volta do Sabino, where 8 of the rebels were left dead and 6 captured, while others, leaving their horses, threw themselves into the sea; and among ours, only two soldiers were lightly wounded, one under the chin and another on the hand, with a sword wound.\n\nWe captured from the enemy 150 horses and 20 tame oxen, after which I withdrew to the town, where 20 barrels of aguardente that the rebels had in storage to send to Piratini were seized, as well as some cassava flour; and since the wagons had already passed the Taquari crossing on the 4th of the current month, I crossed to the other side of the town with the cavalry on the 6th, and on the 7th, between Juca Leão's charqueada and the Arroio dos Ratos, I destroyed a group of rebels, leaving 6 or 7 dead and two seriously wounded prisoners, among the dead was also the notorious killer Eusébio, foreman of Juca Leão. In both this and the previous engagement at Volta do Sabino, all the cavalry performed with remarkable valor, and the good will and courage of the aforementioned officers deserve much praise, as they were all eager to advance first, along with the individuals who armed and mounted rode to Arroio dos Ratos where Mr. Salustiano disembarked with over 300 men from infantry and joined my cavalry; and we marched by land, not only to confront Amaral Ferrador, should he be found, but also to gather and transport some cattle for the supply of the troops, as well as for the hospitals and the town's people; and not finding the rebel force Amaral Ferrador, we collected over 300 cattle from the rebel fields, and with them entered the Picada on the 9th of the current month with all the mentioned cavalry taken from the enemy, thus gathering on said day at the Picada camp all the expedition by sea and land, without loss of a single man."
