  "translation": "The good and compassionate heart of Your Excellency João Bonifácio and others after the abdication; and if to a constituted nation, as Brazil was at that time, that providence was needed, the Rio Grande nation, which finds itself in struggle for its independence, must do so for double the reason. These people are as bold as they are shameless, and for that reason, they become deserving of being treated according to what is suitable for the safety of the State, etc., etc., etc..\n\nYour Excellency"
