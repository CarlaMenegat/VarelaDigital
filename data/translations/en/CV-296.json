  "translation": "My Most Excellent Sir,\n\nThe good and compassionate heart of Your Excellency, Your Excellency João Bonifácio and others after the abdication; and if for a constituted nation, as Brazil then was, that providence was necessary, the Rio-Grandense nation, which is engaged in the struggle to defend its independence, with double reason must do the same. These people are as bold as they are shameless, and for that reason they deserve to be treated as is fitting for the security of the State, etc., etc., etc.\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s sincere and obliged friend Almeida S.C., March 27, 1839"
