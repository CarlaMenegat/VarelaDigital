  "translation": "Piratini, August 9, 1837.\n\nDear Bernardina,\n\nWith the last defeat of Marshal Barreto, I suppose our campaign is secure, and for this reason Senhor Sebastião José de Medeiros Câmara is going to bring you to the house of Senhor Florisbelo dos Santos Pereira, where, as soon as he arrives, he will notify me so that I can see whether you should stay there, or at José Rodrigues Chaves's, or at Canto, until we can finally go to our home.\n\nThere are so many burdens weighing on me presently that I find myself unable to come to fetch you as I ought; but you will forgive me, bearing in mind first and foremost the good of the Fatherland.\n\nAfter reading and distributing the enclosed letters, set out even with the lean oxen to Madruga, where I hope he and João Antunes will provide you with new oxen up to São Diogo pass, where Senhor Florisbelo promises others for you to continue.\n\nBefore your departure, see to it that you send off by Torquato all the slaves you can spare, having Bresque requested beforehand their passports in the name of your brother João, to whom they belong by the business you know we conducted.\n\nAsk Chaves for all you see to be needed for food and clothing for our house, for there is nothing here and it is good that we provide in time for what is necessary.\n\nGive thanks in my name to cousin Senhor Luís Vieira, to cousin Senhora D. Jacinta, and to D. Petrona for the courtesies extended to me and to you, offering them my services for anything in which I may assist them.\n\nIf the lean oxen absolutely cannot come ahead, and at Juca da Costa or on this side at Sampaio they can remain, leave them there to come later to Senhor Florisbelo; entrusting them to someone so that they are not lost, for part of them belong to the State.\n\nIf any cart is missing, ask Madruga or Antunes, and thank all of them for the courtesies extended to us. The little ones' clothes are going to the children, and you will tell Mingote that his reins have been ordered.\n\nEmbrace all our children for me, and receive the heart of your Almeida.\n\nThe clothes the children need it is good that you buy in Cerro Largo."
