  "translation": "Piratini, August 9, 1837.\n\nDear Bernardina\n\nWith the latest defeat of Marshal Barreto, I suppose our campaign is safe and for this reason Mr. Sebastião José de Medeiros Câmara will bring you to the house of Mr. Florisbelo dos Santos Pereira, where as soon as he arrives he will notify me, so I can see whether you should stay there, or at José Rodrigues Chaves’s, or at Canto, until we can finally go home.\n\nThere are so many burdens weighing on me at present that I find myself thus deprived of coming to fetch you as I should; but you will excuse this, bearing in mind first the good of the Fatherland.\n\nAfter reading and distributing the enclosed letters, set out at once, even with the lean oxen, as far as Madruga, where I hope he and João Antunes will provide you with new oxen up to São Diogo pass, where Mr. Florisbelo promises more for you to continue your journey.\n\nBefore leaving, see if you can dispatch through Torquato all the slaves you can spare, sending beforehand to Bresque to request their passports in the name of your brother João, to whom they belong by the business you know we arranged.\n\nAsk Chaves for everything you see that is needed for food and clothing for our household, since there is nothing here and it is good to provide in time what is necessary.\n\nThank in my name cousin Mr. Luís Vieira, cousin Mrs. D. Jacinta, and Mrs. D. Petrona for the kindness shown to me and to you, offering them my services for anything in which I may be of help.\n\nIf the lean oxen absolutely cannot come ahead, and they can stay at Juca da Costa or on this side at Sampaio, leave them there to come later to Mr. Florisbelo; recommending them to someone so they are not lost, since part of them belong to the State.\n\nIf any cart is lacking, ask Madruga or Antunes, and thank them all for the kindness shown to us. The small ones are going to the children and tell Mingote that his backs are ordered.\n\nEmbraces to all our children, and you receive the heart of your Almeida.\n\nThe clothes the children need it is best to buy in Cerro Largo."
