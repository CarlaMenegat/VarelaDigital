  "translation": "With the last defeat of Marechal Barreto, I suppose our campaign is secure, and for this reason, Senhor Sebastião José de Medeiros Câmara is going to bring you to the house of Senhor Florisbelo dos Santos Pereira, where as soon as he arrives, he will inform me so that I can go see whether you should stay there, or at José Rodrigues Chaves, or at Canto, until we can finally go to our house.\n\nThere are so many burdens weighing upon me at present that I find myself unable to come and fetch you as I ought; but you will understand, placing the good of the Fatherland first.\n\nAfter you read and distribute the enclosed letters, set out, even with the lean oxen, to Madruga, where I expect him and João Antunes to provide you with new oxen up to the crossing at São Diogo, where Senhor Florisbelo promises others for you to take along.\n\nBefore your departure, see if you can send away through Torquato all the slaves you can spare, first asking Bresque for their passport in your brother João's name, to whom they belong due to the business we know we conducted.\n\nTo Chaves, send to ask for everything you see you need for food and clothing for our house, since there is nothing here, and it is wise to provide for the necessities in good time.\n\nPlease thank, in my name, cousin Senhor Luís Vieira, cousin Senhora D. Jacinta, and D. Petrona for their favors extended to me and you, offering them my services for anything I can do for them.\n\nIf the lean oxen cannot absolutely come on, and they can stay at Juca da Costa or this side at Sampaio, leave them to come later to Senhor Florisbelo; recommending them to someone so they do not get lost, as some of them belong to the State.\n\nIf a cart is lacking, ask Madruga or Antunes, and please thank them all for their kindness towards us. The little things are for the boys, and tell Mingote that his saddles are ordered."
