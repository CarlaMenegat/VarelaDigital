  "translation": "Piratini, August 9, 1837.\n\nDear Bernardina,\n\nWith the recent defeat of Marshal Barreto, I suppose our campaign is safe, and for this reason Mr. Sebastião José de Medeiros Câmara will come to bring you to the house of Mr. Florisbelo dos Santos Pereira, where as soon as he arrives he will notify me, so that I may see whether you should stay there, or at José Rodrigues Chaves’s, or at Canto’s, until we can finally go to our home.\n\nThere are so many burdens weighing on me at present that I find myself unable to come and fetch you as I should; but you will forgive me, considering above all the good of the Fatherland.\n\nAfter you have read and distributed the enclosed letters, set out, even with the lean oxen, toward Madruga, where I hope he and João Antunes will supply you with new oxen up to São Diogo’s Pass, where Mr. Florisbelo promises others for you to continue your journey.\n\nBefore your departure, see that you dispatch by Torquato all the slaves you can spare, having Bresque request in advance their passports in the name of your brother João, to whom they belong by the business you know we have done.\n\nSend to Chaves a request for everything you see necessary for food and clothing for our household, since here there is nothing, and it is wise to provide in good time the needed supplies.\n\nThank Mr. Luís Vieira, my cousin, Mrs. D. Jacinta, my cousin, and Mrs. D. Petrona for the kindness they have shown to me and you, offering them my services for anything in which I can be of assistance.\n\nIf the lean oxen absolutely cannot proceed further, and can remain at Juca da Costa or on this side at Sampaio, leave them there for later to be brought to Mr. Florisbelo; entrusting them to someone so that they are not lost, since part of them belong to the State.\n\nIf any cart is lacking, ask Madruga or Antunes, and thank them all for the favors shown to us. The small pairs are for the children, and tell Mingote that their backbands are ordered.\n\nHugs to all our children, and you receive the heart of your Almeida.\n\nThe clothing the children may need it is best for you to buy in Cerro Largo."
