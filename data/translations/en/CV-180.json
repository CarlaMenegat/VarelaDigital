  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nWith the losses I suffered after the concordat I obtained on September 15, 1831, I was almost unable to exactly fulfill the obligations I had contracted by the same, and now, due to the political movements that have taken place in the Province, I not only find myself entirely deprived of the ability to put such duties into action, but also, if at such a time I tried to sell the existing goods, besides not finding anyone who would purchase them, they would be considered of such low value that it would amount to a total loss, thus causing serious harm to my creditors and to myself in particular. In view of so many reasons, I dare to beg Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Pelotas, November 16, 1835. From Your Excellency Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir. Examining the contents of your letter of the 16th of the present month, I reply that, on my part, I agree to your proposition. Pelotas, November 24, 1835. Your very attentive worshipful servant Guilherme Rodrigo de Carvalho.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir. [On the verso] City of Pelotas.\n\nAnswered."
