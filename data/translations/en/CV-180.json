  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nWith the damages I suffered after the concordat I obtained on September 15, 1831, I was almost unable to fulfill exactly the obligations I had contracted by it, and now, because of the political movements that have taken place in the Province, not only do I find myself entirely deprived of the power to put such duties into action, but also, if at such a time I tried to sell the existing goods, beyond not finding anyone to purchase them, they would be valued so low that it would amount to a total loss, thus causing serious damage to my creditors and to myself in particular. In view of so many reasons, I dare to beg Your Lordship\n\nMay God keep Your Lordship Pelotas, November 16, 1835. From Your Lordship, Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir. Examining the contents of your letter of the sixteenth of the current month, I answer that, on my part, I agree to your proposition. Pelotas, November 24, 1835. Your very attentive admirer and servant Guilherme Rodrigo de Carvalho.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir. [On the back] City of Pelotas.\n\nAnswered."
