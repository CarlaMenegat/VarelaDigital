  "translation": "With the losses I suffered after the agreement I obtained on September 15, 1831, I almost found myself unable to fulfill the obligations I had incurred. Now, due to the political movements that have taken place in the Province, I not only find myself completely deprived of being able to put such duties into action, but also, if I attempted to sell the existing assets in such circumstances, besides not finding anyone to demand them, they would be regarded as having such diminished value that it would amount to a total loss, thereby causing serious harm to my creditors and to me in particular. In light of so many reasons, I dare to request Your Excellency.\n\nExamining the content of your letter dated the 16th of the bright month, I respond that, on my part, I agree with your proposition."
