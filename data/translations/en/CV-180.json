  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nWith the losses I suffered after the concordat I obtained on September 15, 1831, I was almost unable to precisely fulfill the obligations I had undertaken thereby, and now, due to the political movements that have taken place in the Province, I not only find myself entirely deprived of the ability to put into effect such duties, but also, if at this time I tried to sell the existing goods, besides not finding anyone who would demand them, they would be considered as having such diminished values that this would amount to a total loss, thus causing serious damage to my creditors and to myself in particular. In view of so many reasons, I dare to beg Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Pelotas, November 16, 1835. From Your Excellency Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir. Examining the content of your letter of the 16th of the current month, I reply that, on my part, I agree to your proposal. Pelotas, November 24, 1835. Your very attentive worshipful servant Guilherme Rodrigo de Carvalho.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir. [On the verso] City of Pelotas.\n\nAnswered."
