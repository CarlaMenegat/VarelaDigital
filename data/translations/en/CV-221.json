  "translation": "Piratini, August 9, 1837. Senhor Antônio José Gonçalves Chaves.\n\nThe day before yesterday I received two letters from you dated the 9th of last month, and having to reply to them I will begin with the first. I had 1,500 pesos sent for the purchase of an item that was needed by the State as well as 600$000 to Renovato: and although I did not find grounds in my brother-in-law's order, it was nevertheless good; because I owe Renovato only four hundred and sixty thousand réis, which Your Mercy...\n\nSenhor Pelotas; I have already written to him about the paper money and he replied that he had sent it to Your Mercy.\n\nPerhaps very soon we shall see each other there; and on this date I send my orders for the slaves to be sent to you if you have treated them well, each at 16 pesos, both in winter and summer. I will now proceed to your second letter. The slaves, as I told you, belong to my brother-in-law João Rodrigues Barcelos; I have even made this clear to Victorica, informing him that if he did not approve or send to fetch them, he should replace the money I asked for in advance, which, fortunately, my wife had not yet received: therefore, I send them to Your Mercy.\n\nAs for the jaguars I requested, it is enough that you send me only twenty, since I have been able to withdraw, etc., etc. I am now writing to my father-in-law about what Your Mercy...\n\nI repeat that you will have me there soon, and then we will talk at ease. I wish you all prosperity for being in truth your faithful and old friend.\n\n(a) Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nNB — Everything that Bernardina requests must be sent, as she will see to dressing the blacks as soon as they arrive there.\n\n(a) Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Senhor Antônio José Gonçalves Chaves, Montevideo."
