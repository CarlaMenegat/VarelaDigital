  "translation": "Piratini, August 9, 1837. Senhor Antônio José Gonçalves Chaves.\n\nThe day before yesterday I received two of yours from the 9th of last month, and having to answer them, I will begin with the first. I sent 1,500 pesos for the purchase of an article that was needed for the State, as well as the 600$ to Renovato: and although I found no basis in my brother-in-law’s order, it was good; because I only owe Renovato four hundred and sixty thousand réis, which Your Mercy Your Mercy\n\nThe Senhor Pelotas; I have already written to him about the paper money and he responded that he had forwarded it to Your Mercy.\n\nPerhaps we shall see each other very soon there; and on this date I am issuing my orders for the slaves to be sent to you if they have been well treated at 16 pesos each, both in winter and in summer. I will now move on to your 2nd letter. The slaves, as I told you, belong to my brother-in-law João Rodrigues Barcelos; I have shown this to Victorica, informing him that if he did not approve or send to fetch them, he should repay the money I asked for in advance, which, fortunately, my wife had not yet received: consequently, I am sending them to Your Mercy.\n\nAs for the jaguars I requested, it suffices that you send me only twenty, since I have been able to draw, etc., etc. I am now going to write to my father-in-law about what Your Mercy\n\nI repeat that you will have me there soon, and then we will talk at leisure. I wish you all prosperity, being truly your faithful and old friend.\n\n(a) Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nNB — Whatever Bernardina asks for, be sure to send it, as she will see to clothing the blacks as soon as they arrive there.\n\n(a) Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Senhor Antônio José Gonçalves Chaves, Montevideo."
