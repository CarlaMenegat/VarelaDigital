  "translation": "The day before yesterday I received two of yours from the 9th of last month, and having to respond to them, I will begin with the first. I sent 1,500 pesos for the purchase of an item that was necessary for the State and also the 600$ to Renovato; and although I find no basis in my brother-in-law's order, it was good; because I owe Renovato only four hundred and sixty thousand réis, that Your Grace \n\nMr. Pelotas; I have already written to him about the paper money and he replied to me that he had sent it to Your Grace. \n\nPerhaps we will see each other very soon; and on this date I am sending my orders for the slaves to be sent to you, although I have them treated at 16 pesos each, both in winter and summer. I will now move on to your 2nd letter. The slaves, as I told you, belong to my brother-in-law João Rodrigues Barcelos; I made this clear to Victorica, informing him that if he did not approve or send for them, he would replenish the money I asked him for in advance, which, fortunately, my wife had not yet received: therefore, I will send them to Your Grace. \n\nAs for the ounces I requested, it is enough for you to send me only twenty, since I was able to withdraw, etc., etc. I will write to my father-in-law about what Your Grace \n\nI repeat that you will soon have me there, and then we will talk freely. I wish you all prosperity as I am indeed your faithful and old friend. \n\nNB — Everything that Bernardina asks for should be sent, as she will take care of dressing the blacks as soon as they arrive there."
