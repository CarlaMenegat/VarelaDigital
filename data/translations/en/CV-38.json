  "translation": "I inform Your Excellency that a small rebel force has approached the charqueadas of Costa. In coordination with Major Fernando Kersting, Commander of this Municipality, I sent a detachment to Costa, commanded by Furriel Antônio Rodrigues. However, due to adverse winds, they were unable to arrive in time, and the rebels made their way to the island of Paciência.\n\nDespite my efforts and those of the active Major Commander of the Municipality, as we both marched in pursuit, we could not prevent them from taking some prized horses belonging to Alferes Manuel Antônio of the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard. However, it is highly likely that, due to the prompt measures taken by the aforementioned Major Kersting, both by land and by sea, the rebels not only could not take all the horses from the island but also managed to evade two young brothers of the mentioned alferes who had been captured by the rebels. The detachment commanded by Furriel Rodrigues captured one rebel and injured another.\n\nOn this occasion, I consider it my duty to inform Your Excellency Antônio Francisco de Almeida that, as it is said, four of his sons are among the rebels. He wishes to know about the forays to warn these same rebels, many of whom are his relatives. This Almeida, seeing that the intrigues he orchestrated against Kersting in the army have failed, is now on high alert.\n\nPlease excuse Your Excellency Sete-Pernas, as due to the lack of a boat he has been unable to carry out all kinds of violence against the charqueadores of the river Jacuí."
