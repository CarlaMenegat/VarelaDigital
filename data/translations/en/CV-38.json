  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nI inform Your Excellency that the Jacuí river was approached by a small rebel force to the charqueadas of the Costa. In coordination with Major Fernando Kersting, Commander of this Municipality, I sent a detachment to Costa commanded by Furriel Antônio Rodrigues, and since due to contrary winds it could not arrive on time, the rebels moved to the island of Paciência.\n\nDespite my efforts and those of the active Major Commander of the Municipality, both of us marched in pursuit, we could not prevent them from taking some prized horses belonging to Ensign Manuel Antônio of the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard; but it is highly likely that, due to the prompt measures taken both by land and sea by the mentioned Major Kersting, the rebels were not only unable to take all the horses from the island, but also two young brothers of the said ensign who had been captured by the rebels managed to escape. The detachment commanded by the aforementioned Furriel Rodrigues captured one rebel and wounded another.\n\nOn this occasion, I consider it my duty to inform Your Excellency of Antônio Francisco de Almeida, who, as it is said, has four sons among the rebels, wishes to learn about the expeditions in order to warn the same rebels, many of whom are his relatives. This Almeida, seeing that the intrigues he had made in the army against Kersting were thwarted, is now hastening.\n\nPlease excuse, Your Excellency, Sete-Pernas, who due to the lack of a boat has been able to carry out all kinds of violence against the charqueadores of the coast of the Jacuí river.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency\n\nVila do Triunfo, February 15, 1845.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Tomás José da Silva, Marshal and Commander of the Garrison of Porto Alegre.  \n\nAntônio Pedro de Abreu  \nMajor Commander of the Squadron of Triunfo and vicinity."
