  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that the Jacuí River has seen a small rebel force approaching the charqueadas of the Costa. In coordination with Major Fernando Kersting, Commander of this Municipality, I sent a detachment to the Costa led by Corporal Antônio Rodrigues; however, due to contrary winds, they were unable to arrive in time, and the rebels moved on to the island of Paciência.\n\nDespite my efforts and those of the active Major Commander of the Municipality, both of us marching in pursuit, we could not prevent them from taking some cherished horses belonging to Ensign Manuel Antônio of the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard; but it is highly probable that, through the prompt measures taken by the aforementioned Major Kersting both by land and by sea, the rebels were not only unable to take all the horses from the island, but also two young brothers of the mentioned ensign, who had been captured by the rebels, were able to escape. The detachment commanded by the aforesaid Corporal Rodrigues captured one rebel and wounded another.\n\nOn this occasion, I consider it my duty to inform Your Excellency of Antônio Francisco de Almeida, who, as has been said, has four sons among the rebels and wishes to be informed of the sorties in order to warn the same rebels, many of whom are his relatives. This Almeida, seeing that the intrigues he had plotted against Kersting in the army were foiled, now seeks...\n\nPardon me, Your Excellency, Seven-Legs, who for lack of a boat has been able to inflict all manner of violence on the charqueadores of the coast of the Jacuí River.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency. Vila do Triunfo, February 15, 1845.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Tomás José da Silva, Marshal and Commander of the Garrison of Porto Alegre.\n\nAntônio Pedro de Abreu  \nMajor Commander of the Squadron of Triunfo and assembly."
