  "translation": "Yesterday afternoon I sent Lieutenant Gomes to the other side of Vacacaí to gather news about the enemy, where he was able to learn verbally from a comrade of Captain Alexandre who sent me word that almost at dusk some squadrons were heading to Coxilha do Durasnal near Santa Maria and that there would be about 100 men, and that in the afternoon the fields around that chapel were set on fire, without knowing who did it. The firefighters under Captain Alexandre say that, besides this force, they learned about another, but they could not discover it as it was already late; I am once again sending Lieutenant Gomes to Vacacaí with 4 good and well-mounted men, to see if they can pass through, and then I can make my retreat, trying to join Major Fontoura, according to the order I received from him, with nineteen poorly armed men, among whom there are some very old men and boys of 14 years old, including 2 sons of the late Captain Lino de Brum, whom their mother sent to us. I will keep all my activity, but I always remind Your Excellency that Vacacaí will make my movements slower, because they then have to march through Santa Bárbara down the troop road, if they do not cut me off. I want to remind Your Excellency that in the direction of that point, the four men that you have should alert Jacuí, and that it will perhaps be a verbal warning."
