  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nYesterday afternoon I sent Lieutenant Gomes to the other side of Vacacaí to gather news of the enemy, from where he was able to learn verbally, from a comrade of Captain Alexandre who sent me word, that almost at dusk squadrons were ascending the Coxilha do Durasnal near Santa Maria and that they were about 100 men, having set fire to the fields around the said chapel in the afternoon and it being unknown who did it. The firefighters of Captain Alexandre say that, besides this force, they had news of another, but they could not discover it because it was already late; I am again sending Lieutenant Gomes out to Vacacaí with 4 good and well-mounted men, to see if they pass by the pass, and then I will make my retreat, trying to join Major Fontoura, according to the order I received from him, nineteen poorly armed men, including some very old men and boys of 14 years, among whom are two sons of the late Captain Lino de Brum, whom their mother sent to us. I will maintain all activity on my part, but I always remind Your Excellency that Vacacaí, my reports will be more delayed, because then they have to travel through Santa Bárbara below on the troops’ road, if they do not also cut me off. I recall to tell Your Excellency that Vacacaí in the direction of that point, from the four men you have made to Jacuí to warn, and that it may perhaps be a vocal warning.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nField at Fazenda do Meio, December 18, 1839.  \nVicente de Paula Simões Pires.\n\nCertified correct. Serafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nCopy attached to document CV-125"
