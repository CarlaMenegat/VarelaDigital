  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nYesterday afternoon I sent Lieutenant Gomes to the other side of Vacacaí to gather news of the enemy, from where he was able to learn orally, from a comrade of Captain Alexandre who sent me word, that almost at dusk squadrons were climbing the Coxilha do Durasnal near Santa Maria and that they would be about 100 men, having in the afternoon set fire to the fields around the same chapel and without knowing who did it. The firefighters of Captain Alexandre say that, besides this force, they heard news that there was another, but they could not discover it because it was already late; I send Lieutenant Gomes again to Vacacaí with 4 good men and well mounted, to see if they pass the pass, and then I will make my withdrawal, trying to join Major Fontoura, according to the order I received from him, nineteen badly armed men, including some very old and boys of 14 years, in which are found 2 sons of the late Captain Lino de Brum, whom his mother sent to us. I will keep all my activity, but I always remind Your Excellency that Vacacaí, my reports will be more delayed, because they then have to travel through Santa Bárbara down the troop’s road, if they do not cut me off. I remind Your Excellency that Vacacaí in direction to that point, of the four men you have from Jacuí to notify, and that it may perhaps be by voice signal.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nCamp at Fazenda do Meio, December 18, 1839.  \nVicente de Paula Simões Pires.\n\nIt is correct.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nCopy attached to document CV-125"
