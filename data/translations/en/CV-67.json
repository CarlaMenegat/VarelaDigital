  "translation": "On the fourth of the current month, I marched from this camp with 80 cavalrymen and the 3rd Battalion, as I informed Your Excellency Frutuoso, where the commander was killed, who was the so-called Commander Juca Jacinto, the great murderer Pacheco, and 5 prisoners, among them a Lieutenant Bento, very murderous. I send this to Your Excellency Frutuoso; he was with 90 men. I marched all night with the cavalry and 2 Companies of Infantry commanded by Lieutenant Eduardo and Lieutenant Novas. Lieutenant Colonel Melo stayed at Pavão with the Battalion, and at dawn the enemy was discovered at a distance of half a league; I pursued them for over a league and a half under heavy fire, and due to tiring almost all the horses, the last rebel was not captured; more than 10 saddled horses and four prisoners were left, and one seriously wounded, I believe he will not escape, which is why I left him recovering in a house. Lieutenant Claro José de Sousa was shot in one arm and shoulder, and from a single bullet he had four wounds, and Sergeant Fidélis Pais da Silva was shot in the right hand; I had an officer follow with a party to Rio Pardo to deliver the documents that I brought, with which Your Excellency Your Excellency Toropi: it was bought and placed at that crossing for 48,500 rs. per alqueire, and I hope that Your Excellency Captain Rafael Viana, who asks me to go to Piraju, and I hope that Your Excellency."
