  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Exalted Sir,\n\nOn the fourth of the current month I marched from this camp with 80 cavalrymen and the 3rd Battalion, as I reported to Your Excellency Frutuoso, where the commander was killed, who was the so-called Commander Juca Jacinto, the great murderer Pacheco, and 5 prisoners, among whom was Lieutenant Bento, very murderous, whom I send to Your Excellency. Frutuoso was with 90 men; I marched all night with the cavalry and 2 companies of infantry commanded by Lieutenant Eduardo and Lieutenant Novas. Lieutenant Colonel Melo remained at Pavão with the battalion, and at dawn the enemy was discovered at a distance of half a league; I pursued them for more than a league and a half under heavy fire, and because almost all the horses became tired, it was not concluded with the last rebel; more than 10 saddled horses and four prisoners remained, and one very wounded, whom I believe will not escape, so I left him healing in a house. Lieutenant Claro José de Sousa was shot in an arm and shoulder, and with a single bullet had four wounds; Sergeant Fidélis Pais da Silva was shot in the right hand. I sent an officer with a detachment to Rio Pardo to deliver the reports I brought, with those of Your Excellency. Your Excellency Toropi: was purchased and placed at the said pass at 48,500 réis the alqueire, and I hope that Your Excellency Captain Rafael Viana, who asks me to go to Piraju, and I hope that Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nRincão de São Pedro, August 10, 1841.  \nMost Illustrious and Exalted Sir  \nJoão Paulo dos Santos Barreto  \nBrigadier and Commander of the Army.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant Colonel Commander of the 5th."
