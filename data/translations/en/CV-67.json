  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nOn the fourth of the current month I marched from this camp with 80 cavalrymen and the 3rd Battalion, as I reported to Your Excellency Frutuoso, where the commander was killed, who was called Commander Juca Jacinto, the great assassin Pacheco, and 5 prisoners, among whom was a Lieutenant Bento, very murderous, whom I send to Your Excellency. Frutuoso was with 90 men; I marched all night with the cavalry and 2 companies of infantry commanded by Lieutenant Eduardo and Lieutenant Novas. Lieutenant-Colonel Melo stayed at Pavão with the Battalion, and at dawn the enemy was discovered at a distance of half a league; I pursued them for more than one and a half leagues under heavy fire, and because almost all the horses were exhausted, the last rebel was not captured; more than 10 saddled horses and four prisoners were left behind and one very wounded, whom I believe will not escape, so I left him recovering in a house: Lieutenant Claro José de Sousa shot in an arm and shoulder, who had four wounds from a single bullet, Sergeant Fidélis Pais da Silva shot in the right hand; I sent an officer with a detachment to Rio Pardo to deliver the dispatches that I brought, with those from Your Excellency. Your Excellency Toropi: it was purchased and placed at said pass at 48,500 réis per alqueire, and I hope that Your Excellency Captain Rafael Viana, who asks me to go to Piraju, and I hope that Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Rincão de São Pedro, August 10, 1841. Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto. Brigadier and Commander of the Army. Francisco Pedro de Abreu. Lieutenant-Colonel Commander of the 5th."
