  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nOn the fourth of the current month I marched from this camp with 80 cavalrymen and the 3rd Battalion, as I informed Your Excellency Frutuoso, where the commander was killed, who was the so-called Commander Juca Jacinto, the great murderer Pacheco, and 5 prisoners, among them a Lieutenant Bento, very murderous, whom I send to Your Excellency Frutuoso; he was with 90 men. I marched all night with the cavalry and 2 Companies of Infantry commanded by Lieutenant Eduardo and Lieutenant Novas. Lieutenant-Colonel Melo remained in Pavão with the Battalion, and at dawn the enemy was discovered at a distance of half a league; I pursued them for more than a league and a half under heavy fire, and because almost all the horses were exhausted, the final rebel was not captured; more than 10 horses were saddled and four prisoners and one severely wounded were left behind. I believe he will not escape; therefore, I left him healing in a house. Lieutenant Claro José de Sousa was wounded in one arm and shoulder by a single bullet which caused four wounds; Sergeant Fidélis Pais da Silva was shot in the right hand. I sent an officer with a detachment to Rio Pardo to deliver the dispatches I carried, with those that Your Excellency Your Excellency Toropi: was purchased and placed at said pass at 48,500 réis per alqueire, and I hope that Your Excellency Captain Rafael Viana, who asks me to go to Piraju, and I hope that Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Rincão de São Pedro, August 10, 1841. Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Santos Barreto. Brigadier and Commander of the Army. Francisco Pedro de Abreu. Lieutenant-Colonel Commander of the 5th."
