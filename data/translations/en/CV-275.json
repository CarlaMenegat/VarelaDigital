  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir  \nPiratini, December 14, 1838.\n\nOut of friendship for Your Excellency the Republic, and so as not to remain idle in this short time, I have given the impetus that is given to the part of the Administration entrusted to me. I established the Treasury, organized the Tax Collectors, and devised a method of collection so that the State might have some revenue to address its needs.\n\nIn addition to this, I aided with all my strength the rescue of the cancerous copper currency, drafting the law concerning it, which dishonors the Republic. The instruction of youth, the promotion of industry, and other useful works have not been forgotten by me. The fate of our fellow citizens in the army deserved all my attention, and the Government Gazette has also taken up my time.\n\nHowever, despite so many vigils and discomforts, my services have not met expectations, and systematic opposition, particularly from the Treasury, has strongly convinced me that I must leave the post to one who might perform it better. Thus I do, sending this through the War Secretariat to be presented to Your Excellency.\n\nNor were these the only reasons that forced me so: the lack of means for my subsistence and that of my family, not wishing to be a burden on the Nation in any way, also contributes to this inevitable step. I regret not being able to accompany Your Excellency any longer.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s most obliged friend,  \nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nTo Your Excellency, Sir Bento Gonçalves da Silva, President of the State."
