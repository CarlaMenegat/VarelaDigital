  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nPiratini, December 14, 1838.\n\nOut of friendship for Your Excellency the Republic, and so as not to remain idle in this short time, I gave the impulse that is given to the part of the Administration entrusted to me. I established the Treasury, organized the Collectories and devised a method of collection to provide the State with some income to meet its needs.\n\nAlongside this, I aided with all my strength the redemption of the cancerous copper currency, drafting the law concerning it, which dishonors the Republic. The education of youth, the promotion of industry, and other useful works were not forgotten by me. The fate of our fellow citizens of the army deserved all my attention, and the government’s periodical also did not fail to occupy my time.\n\nDespite so many vigils and troubles, my services have not met expectations, and a systematic opposition, particularly from the Treasury, has fully convinced me that I must leave the position to someone who may better perform it. Thus I do, sending this through the War Secretary to be presented to Your Excellency.\n\nNor were these the only reasons that so compelled me: the lack of means for my subsistence and that of my family, not wishing to be a burden to the Nation in anything, also contributes to this inevitable step. I regret that I cannot accompany Your Excellency any longer.\n\nGod protect Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s most obliged friend,\n\nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nTo Your Excellency Senhor Bento Gonçalves da Silva, President of the State."
