  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir  \nPiratini, December 14, 1838.\n\nOut of friendship for Your Excellency the Republic, and so as not to remain idle during this short time, I gave impetus to the part of the Administration entrusted to me. I established the Treasury, organized the Tax Offices, and devised a method of collection so that the State might have some revenue to meet its necessities.\n\nAlongside this, I assisted with all my strength in the rescue of the cancerous copper coinage, drafting the law concerning it, which dishonors the Republic. The instruction of youth, the encouragement of industry, and other useful works have not been forgotten by me. The fate of our fellow citizens in the army has deserved all my attention, and the Government’s periodic matters have also not failed to take up my time.\n\nHowever, despite so many vigils and inconveniences, my services have not met expectations, and a systematic opposition, particularly from the Treasury, has sufficiently convinced me that I must leave the position to one who may perform it better. Thus I do so, sending this through the War Secretariat to be presented to Your Excellency.\n\nNor were these the only reasons that so compelled me: the lack of means for my subsistence and that of my family, not wishing to be a burden to the Nation in any way, also contributes to this inevitable step. I regret not being able to accompany Your Excellency any longer.\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency.  \nFrom Your Excellency’s most obliged friend,  \nDomingos José de Almeida\n\nTo Your Excellency Mr. Bento Gonçalves da Silva, President of the State."
