  "translation": "Out of friendship for Your Excellency, the Republic, and to avoid idle time during this short period, I gave the impulse that is necessary for the part of the Administration that was entrusted to me. I established the Treasury, organized the Collection Offices, and devised a method of revenue collection so that the State could have some income to meet its needs.\n\nAlongside this, I aided with all my strength the struggle against the cancerous copper coin, drafting the law regarding it, which discredits the Republic. The education of the youth, the promotion of industry, and other useful work were not forgotten by me. The fate of our fellow citizens in the army deserved all my attention, and the government’s bulletin also did not fail to take up my time.\n\nYet despite so many vigils and hardships, my services have not lived up to expectations, and a systematic opposition, particularly from the Treasury, has sufficiently convinced me that I should leave the position for someone who can perform it better. Thus, I do this by sending through the Secretary of War to be presented to Your Excellency.\n\nThese were not the only reasons that forced me to this: the lack of means for my own subsistence and that of my family, not wanting to be a burden to the Nation in any way, also contributes to this unavoidable step. I regret that I can no longer accompany Your Excellency."
