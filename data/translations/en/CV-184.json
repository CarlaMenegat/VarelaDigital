  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart Porto Alegre, December 20, 1835.\n\nThe eagerness that ill-intentioned people constantly show to bring you distress is the most singular thing that can be imagined. Despise the intrigues of these wicked ones, and bear in mind that great labors are made for great hearts. It is surprising that cousin Cipriano, Felizardo, José Pedro, and Bernardino have tolerated, and perhaps even helped, the spreading of rumors about Republics? Indeed, no one can boast that they are not deceived. And now, how will they face it? Anyway, let us move on to other matters. Wednesday, the 23rd, I depart for there, and there I will take care of what I know about myself here.\n\nHugs to our children, to your parents, to godfather José Félix, and to everyone at home. Your husband of the heart Almeida.\n\nI write something else to Antunes; ask godfather to request the letter from him."
