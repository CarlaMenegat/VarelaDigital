  "translation": "My beloved wife of my heart  \nPorto Alegre, December 20, 1835.\n\nThe eagerness that ill-intentioned people constantly display to bring you distress is the most singular thing one can imagine. Despise the snares of these wicked ones, and remember that great labors are made for great hearts. Is it not astonishing that cousin Cipriano, Felizardo, José Pedro, and Bernardino have tolerated there, and perhaps even helped, to spread the rumor of Republics? Indeed, no one can boast of not being deceived. And now, with what face will they remain? Anyway, let us move on to other matters. On Wednesday the 23rd, I depart for there, and there I shall take charge of what I know here concerning myself.\n\nHugs to our children, to your parents, to godfather José Félix, and to everyone at home.  \nYour husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nI shall write a little more to Antunes; let the godfather ask him for the letter."
