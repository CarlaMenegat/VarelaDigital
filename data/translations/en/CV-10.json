  "translation": "Friend and Lord Almeida Salso, December 18, 1842\n\nIf Your Mercy knows Inácio for Uncle Bento in order to give his protection, as I write to Senhor Fontoura, who I suppose nothing will be done on this side; alongside Your Mercy Bento had given me to pay the letters of the rights I should pay, whose order was now contradicted at the Erval Collection, I do not know if by the Minister or the Inspector, and that nothing would be taken into account without a positive order from the government. Therefore, my friend, who is, as I am, with my little fortune sacrificed, and Your Mercy Your Mercy\n\nYour slaves have not been possible to hear news of, and about your yacht in the last letters I had from Vicente nothing had yet been arranged.\n\nI continue to assure you that whenever I am employed in your service, I will satisfy the one who is\n\nYour constant and faithful friend Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu\n\nPost scriptum I beg you very much for the promptness of this matter of mine, since soon I will have to present the order or pay the rights in money."
