  "translation": "If Your Grace knows Inácio for Uncle Bento in order to grant him your protection, just as I write to Senhor Fontoura, whom I suppose nothing will be done for on this side; along with that, Your Grace, Bento had given me to pass letters of the duties I had to pay, whose order has now been contradicted in the Coletoria do Erval, I do not know if by the Minister or by the Inspector, and that nothing should be taken into account without positive order from the government. Therefore, my friend, who is, as I am, with my little fortune sacrificed, and Your Grace Your Grace.\n\nYour slaves have not been possible to know news about them, and regarding your yacht in the last letters I received from Vicente, nothing has been arranged yet.\n\nI continue to assure you that whenever I am employed in your service, it will satisfy whoever it is.\n\nI greatly urge the promptness of this my business, as it will soon be necessary for me to present the order or pay the duties in cash."
