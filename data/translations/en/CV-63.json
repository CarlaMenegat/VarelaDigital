  "translation": "On the 10th of the current month, the passage at the Passo Real of the Rio dos Sinos was concluded at 10 o'clock in the morning, of the 5th Infantry Battalion and the 11th of the same arm and the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard; and on the 11th, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the 2nd Line Cavalry Regiment and the 3rd Line Cavalry Regiment; and at 5 in the afternoon, everything was put in march under the command of Senhor João Frederico Calvaro Caldwell, and, marching all night, we camped on the 12th at the Cateira passage, beyond the village a league and a half. And having news there that the enemy had lifted camp from Capela Grande and Boa Vista with a full force of over 400 cavalry and over 100 infantry and 3 cannons and much baggage and more than 2000 horses, marching toward the parish of Serra, to ascend the Serra; but Major Ourives, with the cavalry force under his command and the 5th Artillery Battalion, was able to take the lead, and the rebels retreated to the passage of the Tramandaí River. And by virtue of the news of this retreat, the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard and 30 men from the 3rd Regiment marched with forced marches to press on their rear; and 3 leagues before reaching said passage, I learned that the aforementioned rebels had passed said passage hastily, losing 4 men drowned and some armament and over 150 horses, of which they beheaded over 50. And crossing beyond the Tramandaí River, they tried to pass through the paths of Três Forquilhas, and already being attacked there by Major Rodrigues, the rebels had to retreat hastily to Torres, to cross through the path of the Verde River, having already lost more than 200 men who deserted and from 800 to 1000 horses due to the haste of the march. And from this, Jerônimo de Barros, from Major Ourives’ force, who was able to escape him half a day before entering the Path, assured that the enemy, in the demoralization they were in, could not ascend the Serra with more than 200 men and 500 horses. And I immediately reported this to Major Ourives.\n\nIn light of this, seeing my pursuit to be futile, I retired to the Quilombo to rest the horses, intending to join the next day with the lieutenant colonel commanding the force, where we are at the orders of Your Excellency Porto Alegre, December 17, 1840."
