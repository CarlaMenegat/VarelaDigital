  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nOn the 10th of the current month, the passage at the Passo Real of the Rio dos Sinos was completed, around 10 o'clock of that day, by the 5th Infantry Battalion and the 11th of the same branch and the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard; and on the 11th, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, by the 2nd Line Cavalry Regiment and the 3rd Line Cavalry Regiment; and at 5 in the afternoon, all set out under the command of Mr. João Frederico Calvaro Caldwell and, marching throughout the night, we rested on the 12th at the pass of Cateira, beyond the Aldeia, a league and a half away. Having received news there that the enemy had lifted camp from Capela Grande and Boa Vista with all the force of more than 400 cavalrymen and more than 100 infantrymen and 3 guns and much baggage and more than 2,000 horses, marching directly towards the parish of Serra, to ascend the Serra by that route; but Major Ourives, with the cavalry force under his command and the 5th Artillery Battalion, was able to take the front and the rebels retreated to the river Tramandaí pass. And by virtue of the news of this retreat, the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard and 30 men of the 3rd Regiment marched in pursuit with forced marches to strike their rear; and three leagues before reaching the said pass, I received news that said rebels had suddenly crossed that pass, losing there 4 men drowned and some armament and more than 150 horses, of which they slaughtered more than 50. And crossing beyond the river Tramandaí they tried to pass through the paths of the Three Forks, and these already being attacked by Major Rodrigues, the rebels had to retreat hastily to Torres, to cross the path of the Verde river, having already lost more than 200 deserted men and from 800 to 1,000 horses due to the precipitous march. And from this Jerônimo de Barros, from Major Ourives's force, who was able to escape half a day before the entrance of the Path, asserting this soldier that the enemy, due to the demoralization they were in, cannot ascend the Serra with more than 200 men and 500 horses. And I immediately reported this to Major Ourives.\n\nIn view of this, seeing my pursuit was useless, I withdrew to the Quilombo, to rest the horses, joining the next day with the lieutenant-colonel commanding the force, where we remain at the orders of Your Excellency.\n\nPorto Alegre, December 17, 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Sousa Barreto  \nJoão Paulo dos Santos Barreto  \nMost Worthy Commander-in-Chief of the Army of this Province.  \n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant-Colonel"
