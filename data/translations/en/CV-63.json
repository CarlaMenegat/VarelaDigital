  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nOn the 10th of the current month, the passage at the Passo Real of the Rio dos Sinos was completed, around 10 o'clock that day, by the 5th Infantry Battalion and the 11th of the same arm, and the 5th National Guard Cavalry Corps; and on the 11th, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the 2nd Line Cavalry Regiment and the 3rd Line Cavalry Regiment; and at 5 in the afternoon, everything set out under the command of Senhor João Frederico Calvaro Caldwell, and marching all night, we rested on the 12th at the Passo da Cateira, beyond the Aldeia by a league and a half. There, having news that the enemy had lifted camp from Capela Grande and Boa Vista with all their force of over 400 cavalrymen and over 100 infantrymen and 3 pieces of artillery and much baggage and over two thousand horses, marching straight towards the freguesia of Serra, to ascend the Serra there; but Major Ourives, with the cavalry force under his command and the 5th Artillery Battalion, was able to take them in front and the rebels retreated to the Passo do Rio Tramandaí. And by virtue of news of this retreat, the 5th National Guard Cavalry Corps and 30 men of the 3rd Regiment marched in pursuit with forced marches to harry their rear; and three leagues before reaching said pass, I had news that said rebels had crossed the pass precipitously, losing there 4 men drowned and some armament and over 150 horses, of which they slaughtered over 50. And passing beyond the Rio Tramandaí, they attempted to cross at the trails of the Três Forquilhas, and since these were already attacked by Major Rodrigues, the rebels had to retreat precipitously to Torres, to cross at the trail of the Rio Verde, having already lost more than 200 men deserted and from 800 to 1000 horses due to the precipitation of the march. And this from Jerônimo de Barros, of Major Ourives’ force, who was able to escape half a day before entering the trail, affirming that the enemy, by the demoralization they were in, would not manage to ascend the Serra with more than 200 men and 500 horses. And I immediately communicated this to Major Ourives.\n\nIn view of this, seeing my pursuit was useless, I withdrew to Quilombo, to rest the horses, joining the next day with the lieutenant-colonel commanding the force, where we remain at the orders of Your Excellency.\n\nPorto Alegre, 17 December 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Sousa Barreto  \nJoão Paulo dos Santos Barreto  \nMost Worthy Commander-in-Chief of the Army of this Province.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu  \nLieutenant-Colonel"
