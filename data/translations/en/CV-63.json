  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nOn the 10th of the current month, the passage at Passo Real do Rio dos Sinos was completed, at about 10 o'clock of the day, by the 5th Infantry Battalion and the 11th of the same branch, and the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard; and on the 11th, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the 2nd Line Cavalry Regiment and the 3rd Line Cavalry Regiment; and at 5 in the afternoon, everything set out on marches under the command of Senhor João Frederico Calvaro Caldwell, and marching all night, we made a halt on the 12th at the pass of Cateira, one and a half leagues beyond Aldeia. There, having news that the enemy had raised camp from Capela Grande and Boa Vista with the full force of 400 and some cavalrymen and 100 and some infantrymen, and 3 artillery pieces, much baggage, and more than 2,000 horses, marching directly towards the parish of Serra to climb the Serra there; but Major Ourives, with the cavalry force under his command and the 5th Artillery Battalion, was able to take the lead, and the rebels retreated to the pass of Rio Tramandaí. As a result of the news of this retreat, the 5th Cavalry Corps of the National Guard and 30 soldiers from the 3rd Regiment marched in forced marches to cut off their rear; and three leagues before arriving at said pass, I received news that the said rebels had passed that pass hastily, losing there 4 soldiers drowned and some armament, and about 150 horses, of which they slaughtered more than 50. Passing beyond Rio Tramandaí, they tried to pass through the trails of Três Forquilhas, and these already being attacked by Major Rodrigues, the rebels had to retreat hastily to Torres to pass through the trail of the Verde River, having already lost more than 200 men by desertion and from 800 to 1,000 horses due to the precipitation of the march. And from this Jerônimo de Barros, from Major Ourives’ force, who managed to escape half a day before entering the trail, assured said soldier that the enemy, due to the demoralization they were in, cannot ascend the Serra with more than 200 men and 500 horses. And this I immediately reported to Major Ourives.\n\nIn view of this, seeing my pursuit was useless, I withdrew to Quilombo to give rest to the horses, joining the next day with the lieutenant-colonel commander of the force, where we remain at the orders of Your Excellency. Porto Alegre, December 17, 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir João Paulo dos Sousa Barreto João Paulo dos Santos Barreto Most Worthy Commander-in-Chief of the Army of this Province. Francisco Pedro de Abreu. Lieutenant-Colonel"
