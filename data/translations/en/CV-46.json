  "translation": "Given the absolute necessity, for the sake of upholding the law and legality, I am requesting yet another active ferry for the transport of animals to assist not only in the arrival and departure of the animals from the nation I am in charge of, which exist or might go to the adjacent islands of this city, but also for some necessary attempt to confront the enemy at any point at sea with at least a force of one hundred cavalrymen; and since the two ferries currently available cannot regularly transport more than fifty horses, a very small amount for achieving good success, and this is not only to engage the enemy, but also for some cavalry surprise, which is so necessary for us, as well as in extreme need of meat for the hospitals and the populace of this city. For these reasons, I remind Your Excellency."
