  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nBeing of absolute necessity, for the good of upholding the law and legality, another pulsating ferry for the transit of animals to aid not only the coming and going of the animals of the nation of which I am in charge, that exist, or may further go to the islands adjacent to this city, but also for some necessary attempt to assault the enemy at any point of the sea with a force of at least one hundred cavalrymen; and since the two ferries currently available cannot regularly carry more than fifty horses, a very small number for achieving good success, and this not only to strike the enemy, but also for some cavalry surprise that is so necessary to us, as well as in extreme need of meat for the hospitals and people of this city. For these reasons I remind Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nGarrison in Porto Alegre, October 13, 1838.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Tomás José da Silva — Brigadier and Commander of the Garrison of this capital.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu. Major.\n\nIt is in accordance.  \nJosé Cesário de Abreu. Captain in Charge of the Office."
