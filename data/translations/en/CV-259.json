Antônia, in Barra de Camaquã, so that the wagons leaving from here to transport such goods can go directly to the place of receipt of the cargo; and this can be arranged by Your Honor Francisco Antônio Machado, who is leaving from here today with wagons for the transportation of the aforementioned goods."
