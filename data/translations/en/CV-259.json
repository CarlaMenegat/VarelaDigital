Antônia, at Barra de Camaquã, so that the carts sent from here with the purpose of transporting such effects may go directly to the place of receipt of the cargo; and this can be done immediately by Your Excellency Francisco Antônio Machado, who today leaves here with carts for the conveyance of the said effects.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency,\n\nDomingos José de Almeida"
