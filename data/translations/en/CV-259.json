Antônia, at Barra de Camaquã, so that the carts sent from here with the purpose of transporting such goods can go directly to the place where the cargo is received; and this may be done immediately by Your Lordship Francisco Antônio Machado, who leaves here today with carts for the transport of the aforementioned goods.\n\nGod preserve Your Lordship  \nDomingos José de Almeida"
