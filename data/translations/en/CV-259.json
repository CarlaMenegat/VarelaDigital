Antônia, at Barra de Camaquã, so that the carts sent from here to transport such effects may go directly to the place of receiving the cargo; and this can be done promptly by Your Lordship Francisco Antônio Machado, who today departs from here with carts for the conveyance of the aforementioned effects.\n\nGod preserve Your Lordship,\n\nDomingos José de Almeida"
