And I marched with the rest of the force directly to the parish of Encruzilhada, which I entered on May 26, without encountering any resistance; finding the parish deserted because the inhabitants had fled frightened by the dreadful news spread by the farrapos who were moving from hill to hill, there I made the inhabitants aware of the contrary, and giving them the proclamations of Your Excellency Captain Boaventura with 40 men beyond Encruzilhada, and descend along the bank of Camaquã, who joined me in São José, with 200 horses; I passed to the other side of Camaquã and made Lieutenant Isaías follow to the chapel of Boqueirão with a detachment, and there he gathered the horses he could and descended to the Braga ranch, which today is the winter quarters of José Gomes Jardim, the Vice-President of the Republic, to join me, and crossing back the Camaquã Major Mariano who had gathered 300 tame horses and over 200 colts and 40 tame and wild mules. Marching to São José I sent Captain Antônio Fernando with the soldiers of the 2nd and 3rd Brigades carrying 400 of the best horses and 80 colts as requested by the Most Illustrious Colonel Loureiro, who was going to the campaign and was lacking horses; and I returning to this place on the 9th of this month, with 800 tame horses, 200 colts, and 40 tame and wild mules, having encountered no assemblies other than small groups in the woods, of whom three were killed, and saddles and arms taken.\n\nThe woods are full of men deserting from the enemy ranks, saying that only the leader will gather; the great influencers are very discouraged, and say that, from the moment they learned that the farrapos were caged inside Taquari, they judged the Republic lost, and many have already requested amnesty from the Government; I, Most Excellent Sir\n\nThis is what I have the honor to bring to the knowledge of Your Excellency Santo Amaro, June 12, 1840.  \nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Manuel Jorge Rodrigues, Lieutenant-General Commander-in-Chief of the Army in Operations in this Province.  \nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel."
