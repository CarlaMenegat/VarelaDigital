  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nBy virtue of the orders I received from Your Excellency Captain Rafael José Viana on the 21st, with 50 men of the 5th Corps and Ensign Prestes, of the 3rd Corps, with 30 men, to gather the cavalry units from the vicinity of Cerro do Roque and Erval, to maintain the strength of my command which was on foot, which the said Captain and Ensign Prestes gathered three hundred and some; and I marching with one hundred and some men from the corps of my command and 50 men of the 3rd Brigade commanded by Captain Antônio Fernando, which in total amounted to 230, and making junction at Cerro do Roque, I sent Major Mariano Martins with one hundred and some men to cross the Serra de São João and raid the coast of Velhaco and Camaquã. I marched with the remainder of the force directly to the parish of Encruzilhada, which I entered on May 26, without encountering any resistance; finding the parish deserted as the inhabitants had withdrawn frightened by the terrifying news spread by the farrapos who were moving from ridge to ridge, there I made known to the inhabitants the contrary, and giving them the proclamations of Your Excellency Captain Boaventura with 40 men beyond Encruzilhada, and descending along the bank of Camaquã, who joined me at São José with 200 horses; I crossed to the other side of Camaquã and sent Lieutenant Isaías to the chapel of Boqueirão with a detachment, who gathered as many horses as he could and descended to the Braga ranch, where today is the winter quarters of José Gomes Jardim, the vice-president of the Republic, to join me, and Major Mariano crossing the Camaquã who had gathered 300 tame horses and 200 and some colts and 40 tame and wild mules. Marching towards São José I sent Captain Antônio Fernando with the troops of the 2nd and 3rd Brigades carrying 400 of the best horses and 80 colts as requested by the Most Illustrious Colonel Loureiro, who was heading to the campaign and was lacking horses; and I returning to this place on the 9th of the current month, with 800 tame horses, 200 colts, and 40 tame and wild mules, having encountered no gathering except small groups in the woods, in which three were killed, and saddles and weapons taken.\n\nThe woods are full of men deserted from the enemy ranks, saying that only the leader will gather; the great influential men are very discouraged, and they say that from the moment they learned that the farrapos were cornered inside Taquari, they judged the Republic lost, and many are already requesting amnesty from the Government; I, Most Excellent Sir\n\nThat is what I have the honor to bring to the knowledge of Your Excellency Santo Amaro, June 12, 1840. Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir Manuel Jorge Rodrigues, Lieutenant-General Commander-in-Chief of the Army in Operations in this Province. Francisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel."
