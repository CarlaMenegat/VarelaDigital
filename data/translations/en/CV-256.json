  "translation": "My good President and friend Piratini, September 20, 1838.\n\nI inform Your Excellency that General Lima ceded in Pelotas to João dos Santos Quimindá a slave belonging to the absentee Araújo, and she remained in his house until the 17th of this month, the day on which she was sent to me by the Minister of War to be heard and to decide what was proper. She complains of mistreatment and indeed I am told she was beaten.\n\nQuimindá reclaimed her from me, and when I wanted to hand her over, pretending to do so, she strongly opposed it, even in his presence, asking to be sold to someone else, and protesting that she would never serve him. In view of such a statement I have detained her, knowing that he would want to take revenge, as is natural, and that she might commit some madness. Quimindá claims her firmly: tell me, Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency Almeida"
