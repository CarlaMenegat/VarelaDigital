  "translation": "My good President and friend\n\nPiratini, September 20, 1838.\n\nI consult Your Excellency. General Lima ceded in Pelotas to João dos Santos Quimindá a slave belonging to the absentee Araújo, and she remained in his house until the 17th of this month, the day on which she was sent to me by the Minister of War to hear her and decide what was appropriate. She complains of mistreatment and indeed I am told she was beaten.\n\nQuimindá claimed her from me, and when I wanted to hand her over, by pretense, she strongly opposed it, even in his presence, asking that she wished to be sold to someone else, and protesting that she would never serve him. In view of such a declaration, I have detained her knowing that he is likely to want revenge, as is natural, and that she might commit some madness. Quimindá claims her persistently: tell me, Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency Almeida"
