  "translation": "I consult Your Excellency regarding General Lima, who ceded to João dos Santos Quimindá, in Pelotas, a slave of the absent Araújo, and she remained in his house until the 17th of this month, the day on which she was sent to me by the Minister of War to hear her and resolve what was fitting. She complains of mistreatment and, in fact, they tell me she has been beaten.\n\nQuimindá has claimed her back, and wanting to return her, under pretense, she strongly opposed it, even in his presence, asking to be sold to someone else, and protesting that she would never serve him. In light of such a statement, I have detained her knowing that he will want to take revenge, as is natural, and that she may commit some reckless act. Quimindá claims her effectively: tell me, Your Excellency."
