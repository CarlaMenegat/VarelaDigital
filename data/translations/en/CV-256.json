  "translation": "My good President and friend Piratini, September 20, 1838.\n\nI consult Your Excellency General Lima; he ceded in Pelotas to João dos Santos Quimindá a slave belonging to the absentee Araújo, and she remained in his house until the 17th of this month, the day on which she was sent to me by the Minister of War so that I might hear her and decide what was appropriate. She complains of mistreatment and indeed I am told she was beaten.\n\nQuimindá has a claim on her, and when I wanted to deliver her, she strongly opposed, even in his presence, asking to be sold to someone else, and protesting that she would never serve him. In view of such a declaration, I have detained her, knowing that he will want to take revenge, as is natural, and that she might commit some folly. Quimindá claims her forcibly: tell me, Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency Almeida"
