  "translation": "My respectable compatriot and friend Bagé, April 12, 1843.\n\nI had the pleasure of receiving your esteemed letter of the 7th of the current month, in which, beseeching me for the good of the Fatherland, you request my cooperation in the important mission that has been entrusted to you; I profoundly regret, citizen and friend, that my health troubles and a thousand other circumstances which I am not at liberty to mention, forbid me from presently engaging in any service.\n\nFirm in my resolutions by certain principles, I have determined to voluntarily submit to my own nullity, and although I do not envy those who make sacrifices for their country, I am nevertheless happily aware that my assistance cannot be useful to you in any matter.\n\nNonetheless, the good of my Fatherland is an object of such dedication for me, that as soon as I am able I will not hesitate to render all my attentions to it. Meanwhile, I cordially thank you for your remembrance as a proof of the high consideration you entertain for me, with which I am also with esteem and respect.\n\nYour compatriot and friend, very obliged  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nPresidency of the Republic Secretariat  \nLieutenant Colonel Manuel Lucas de Oliveira, Commander of the 1st National Guard Brigade. Wherever he may be. From Lieutenant Colonel Alencastre."
