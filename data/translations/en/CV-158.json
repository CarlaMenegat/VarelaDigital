  "translation": "My respectable fellow countryman and friend   \nBagé, April 12, 1843.\n\nI had the pleasure of receiving your esteemed letter of the 7th of this month, in which, beseeching me for the good of the Fatherland, you request my cooperation in the important mission entrusted to you; I deeply regret, citizen and friend, that my health troubles and a thousand other circumstances which I am not allowed to mention, prevent me from presently engaging in any service.\n\nFirm in my resolutions based on certain principles, I have determined to voluntarily submit to my own nullity, and although I do not know jealousy of those who make sacrifices in favor of their country, nevertheless I happily acknowledge that my cooperation cannot be useful to you in any manner.\n\nNonetheless, the good of my Fatherland is an object of such dedication to me, that as soon as I can I will not hesitate to offer it all my attentions. Meanwhile, I cordially thank you for your remembrance as proof of the high consideration you think I deserve, with which I am also with esteem and respect.\n\nYour fellow countryman and very grateful friend,   \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nPresidency of the Republic Secretariat   \nLieutenant Colonel Manuel Lucas de Oliveira, Commander of the 1st National Guard Brigade. Wherever he may be found. From Lieutenant Colonel Alencastre."
