  "translation": "I had the pleasure of receiving your esteemed letter of the 7th of this month, in which, invoking me for the good of the Fatherland, you request my cooperation in the important mission that has been entrusted to you; I feel deeply, citizen and friend, that my health troubles and a thousand other circumstances that I cannot mention, prevent me from engaging in any service at present.\n\nFirm in my resolutions based on certain principles, I have determined to voluntarily submit to my own nullity, and although I do not wish to feel envy for those who make sacrifices for their country, I fortunately know that my assistance cannot be of use to you in any way.\n\nNevertheless, the good of my Fatherland is an object of such dedication for me that as soon as I am able, I will not hesitate to offer you all my efforts. Meanwhile, I cordially thank you for your remembrance as a sign of the high regard you have for me, which I also reciprocate with esteem and respect."
