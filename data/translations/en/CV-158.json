  "translation": "My respectable compatriot and friend  \nBagé, April 12, 1843.\n\nI had the pleasure of receiving your esteemed letter of the 7th of this month, in which, imploring me for the good of the Fatherland, you request my cooperation in the important mission that was entrusted to you; I deeply regret, citizen and friend, that my health troubles and a thousand other circumstances which I am not able to mention forbid me from engaging at present in any service.\n\nFirm in my resolutions by certain principles, I have determined voluntarily to submit to my own nullity, and although I may not envy those who make sacrifices in favor of their country, nevertheless I happily know that my assistance cannot be of any use to you.\n\nNonetheless, the good of my Fatherland is such an object of dedication to me that as soon as I can, I will not hesitate to offer it all my care. Meanwhile, I cordially thank you for your remembrance as a proof of the high regard you have for me, with which I am also, with esteem and respect,\n\nYour compatriot and friend, very grateful,  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre\n\nPresidency of the Republic Secretariat  \nLieutenant Colonel Manuel Lucas de Oliveira,  \nCommander of the 1st Brigade of the National Guard.  \nWherever you find him.  \nFrom Lieutenant Colonel Alencastre."
