  "translation": "Canguçu, October 20, 1843.  \nIllustrious Sir Urbano Soares Urbano Soares da Silva  \nMy esteemed relative and friend.\n\nThe time has come for all the Rio-Grandenses who are friends of their homeland to look with that attention which our unfortunate homeland deserves, which for more than eight years has suffered the persecutions and ruins of a civil war. It seems to me that my relative will be convinced that this province would gain no advantage in separating from the Empire, and even if it were not possible to achieve this separation; then the delay of the war will only serve to destroy our homeland; Bento Gonçalves and Neto are today making war against the inhabitants of this department and those men who have helped them to wage war against their own interests and those of their compatriots; therefore I beg my relative to make a swift journey here, not only to have the pleasure of meeting him, but also to discuss the interests of our homeland which seems to me to deserve his great attention; rely on this one who prides himself on being your relative and friend.\n\nNota Bene\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu"
