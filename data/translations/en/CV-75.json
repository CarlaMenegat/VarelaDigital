  "translation": "The time has come for all Rio-grandenses who love their homeland to look with the attention that our unfortunate country deserves, which has suffered the persecutions and ruin of a civil war for over eight years. It seems to me that my relative will be convinced that this province would gain nothing from separating from the Empire, and that it is even impossible to achieve this separation; therefore, the prolonged war will only serve to destroy our homeland. Bento Gonçalves and Neto are currently waging war against the inhabitants of this department, and those men who have helped them wage war against their own interests and those of their fellow countrymen. Therefore, I urge my relative to make a swift trip here, not only to enjoy getting to know me but also to discuss the interests of our homeland, which I believe deserves much attention; consider this from one who values being your relative and friend."
