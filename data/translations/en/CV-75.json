  "translation": "Canguçu, October 20, 1843.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Urbano Soares Urbano Soares da Silva  \nMy dear relative and friend.\n\nThe time has come for all the Rio-Grandenses who love their homeland to look with the attention it deserves upon our unfortunate homeland, which for more than eight years has suffered the persecutions and ruins of a civil war. It seems to me that my relative will be convinced that this province would gain no advantage from separating from the Empire, and even if such separation were not possible to achieve; then the prolongation of the war will only serve for the destruction of our homeland; Bento Gonçalves and Neto today are waging war against the inhabitants of this department, and those men who have helped them are making war against their own interests and those of their compatriots; therefore I beg my relative to come here at a gallop, not only to have the pleasure of meeting him but also to discuss the interests of our homeland, which I believe should deserve much of his attention; dispose of this one who esteems himself to be your relative and friend.\n\nNota Bene\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu"
