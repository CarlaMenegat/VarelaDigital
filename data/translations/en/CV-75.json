  "translation": "Canguçu, October 20, 1843.\n\nIllustrious Sir Urbano Soares Urbano Soares da Silva\n\nMy dear relative and friend.\n\nThe time has come for all the people of Rio Grande who love their homeland to look with the attention that our unhappy fatherland deserves, which for more than eight years has suffered the persecutions and ruins of a civil war. It seems to me that my relative will be convinced that this province would gain no advantage from separation from the Empire, and even if such separation were not possible; then the prolongation of the war will only serve for the destruction of our fatherland; Bento Gonçalves and Neto are today waging war against the inhabitants of this department and those men who have helped them to wage war against their own interests and those of their compatriots; therefore I beg my relative to come here at a gallop, not only to have the pleasure of meeting him, but to discuss the interests of our fatherland which it seems to me should deserve his great attention; dispose of this one who prides himself on being your relative and friend.\n\nNota Bene\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu"
