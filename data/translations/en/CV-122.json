  "translation": "Caçapava, December 16, 1839\n\nIllustrious Sir,\n\nAlthough our acquaintance is very old, despite not being based on closer relations, I am nevertheless convinced that it has come to Your Lordship's knowledge.\n\nDespite this, my hopes were not fulfilled, and I was forced to submit to the greatest of sacrifices and lay on the altar of the Fatherland any considerations, despite some unfavorable prejudices that may have formed against me, perhaps making me the target of certainly unfounded judgments, given my disinterest, my conduct, and my social affections. A poorly conceived opinion of me, without legitimate foundation, has outweighed all my excuses, and that is why I submitted only to the law of necessity, a law that strongly prevails over the human spirit. I will regret your...\n\nYour Lordship,\n\nI am with esteem, respect, and consideration,  \nYour Lordship’s  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
