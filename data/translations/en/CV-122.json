  "translation": "Caçapava, December 16, 1839\n\nMost Illustrious Sir,\n\nAlthough our acquaintance is very old, and notwithstanding that it is not founded on closer relations, yet, persuaded that it has come to Your Lordship’s knowledge,\n\nDespite this, my hopes were not fulfilled, and it was necessary for me to submit to the greatest of sacrifices and lay upon the altar of the Fatherland any considerations, notwithstanding some unfavorable prejudices formed against me, perhaps making me the target of certainly unfounded judgments, considering my disinterest, my conduct, and my social affections. A poorly conceived opinion about me and without legitimate foundation rendered all my excuses of no weight, and that is why I submitted only to the law of necessity, a law that greatly rules over the human spirit. I shall regret your...\n\nYour Lordship,\n\nI am with esteem, respect, and consideration,\n\nOf Your Lordship\n\nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
