  "translation": "From the letter of Manuel Rodrigues Barbosa, it can be seen that he sent 30 ounces for the State's expenses; these have not been delivered to me since the 12th of this current July; on the 25th I asked his son, the conductor of the same, in order to pay six with which on behalf of the State I sent to Lieutenant Colonel José de Matos, requested from various people, only because this officer wanted to aid his family cornered in Porto Alegre; said son of Barbosa replied that he had delivered them to the Excellent Sir without informing me of anything about it; first learning that they did not exist in the Treasury, I addressed a written request to said Excellent Sir Juca Neto to have bought horses in Taim, and to allocate them for payment of the same. Not satisfied with the evasion, I make the following reflections about it.\n\nPutting aside the more than evident prejudice in the secrecy that was kept with me regarding the receipt of this sum from the nation, which should have been deposited in the Treasury and not in his house, even for the purpose it appears; noting that I have spent more than twelve contos de réis with the State, and am owing a foreigner two contos one hundred and some thousand réis for fabric purchases for the same State, and which should have been paid, as it was on the same day the 26th: nothing, absolutely nothing is as outrageous as the preference of payment!!!! Homeland! here are the rightful republicans who... and direct your destinies."
