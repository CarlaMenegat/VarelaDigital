  "translation": "By the letter from Manuel Rodrigues Barbosa, it is seen that he sent 30 ounces for the expenses of the State; these have not been delivered to me since the 12th of the current July; on the 25th, I asked his son, the conductor of the same, for them in order to pay six ounces which, on account of the State, I sent to Lieutenant Colonel José de Matos requested by several, simply because this officer wanted to assist his family trapped in Porto Alegre; said son of Barbosa replied that he had delivered them to the Excellent Sir, who did not report anything to me about it; first learning that they did not exist in the Treasury, I addressed in writing to the said Excellent Sir Juca Neto regarding having purchased horses in Taim, and intended to use them for payment of the same. Not being satisfied with the evasive, I make the following reflections on the matter.\n\nPutting aside the more than manifest bias in the secrecy that he kept with me regarding the receipt of this sum from the nation, which should have been deposited in the Treasury and not in his house, even for the purpose it apparently had; noting that having spent more than twelve contos de réis with the State, and owing a foreigner two contos and some thousand réis for purchases of goods for the same State, and which should be paid, as it was on the same day the 26th: nothing, absolutely nothing, is as outrageous as the preference of payment!!!! Homeland! here are the just republicans who........ and direct your destinies."
