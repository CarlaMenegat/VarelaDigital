  "translation": "By Manuel Rodrigues Barbosa's letter, it is seen that 30 ounces were sent for the State's expenses; these have not been delivered to me since the 12th of this current July; on the 25th I asked his son, the conductor of the same, for them in order to pay six ounces with which, on account of the State, I sent to Lieutenant Colonel José de Matos requested from several people, only because this officer wanted to aid his family cornered in Porto Alegre; the said son of Barbosa replied that he had delivered them to His Excellency, without having communicated anything to me about it; first knowing that they did not exist in the Treasury, I wrote to said His Excellency Juca Neto that he had bought horses in Taim and intended them to pay for the same. Not accommodating himself to this evasiveness, I make the following reflections on the matter.\n\nPutting aside the more than manifest prejudice in the secrecy with which he kept the receipt of this sum from the nation with me, which should have been deposited in the Treasury and not at his house, even for the purpose it appeared; noting that I had spent more than twelve contos de réis with the State, and being indebted to a foreigner two contos and a few thousand réis for purchases of fabric for the same State, which should have been paid, as it was on the 26th of the same day: nothing, absolutely nothing is as outraging as the preference of payment!!!! Homeland! here are the just republicans who........ and direct your destinies."
