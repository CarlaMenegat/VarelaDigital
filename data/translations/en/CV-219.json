  "translation": "From the letter of Manuel Rodrigues Barbosa, it can be seen that he sent 30 ounces for state expenses; these were not delivered to me since the 12th of this current July; on the 25th, I asked his son, who was in charge of them, for them in order to pay the six ounces that I sent to Lieutenant Colonel José de Matos on behalf of the state, requested from various quarters, solely because this officer wanted to assist his family cornered in Porto Alegre; Barbosa's son replied that he had delivered them to the Excellency, without having informed me about it; knowing first that they did not exist in the Treasury, I wrote to the said Excellency Juca Neto, stating that I had purchased horses in Taim, and intended to use them for payment of the same. Not settling for the evasion, I make the following reflections.\n\nSetting aside the more than evident bias in the secrecy he maintained regarding the receipt of this amount from the nation, which should have been deposited in the Treasury and not in his house, even for the purpose it apparently serves; noting that I have spent more than twelve contos of réis with the state, and owe a foreigner two contos and more than a hundred thousand réis for the purchase of goods for the same state, which should have been paid as it was on the same day, the 26th: nothing, absolutely nothing, is as revolting as the preference for payment!!!! Homeland! Here are the just republicans who........ and direct your destinies."
