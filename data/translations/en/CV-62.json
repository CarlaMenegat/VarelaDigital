  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that Neto was in São José gathering men to attack and persecute me, with a police force that I had placed in Encruzilhada. I proceeded to gather some horsemen and pursue them, walking by night and ambushing along the paths, which enabled me to reach São José without being detected by the enemy's advanced forces; but I did not find him there as he had passed Camaquã and continued to Piratini. Yesterday a friend of mine arrived from elsewhere, who left Colonel Loureiro at the Santana chapel with 900 men to join Aníbal, who had 200 men, so the next day they would join forces and then intended to pursue Guedes, who was nearby with 500 men and has killed some rebel officers who were holding meetings for the rebels; a lieutenant defected from the rebels, and many horses and men have been gathered.\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency. Cordilheira, July 3, 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Manuel Jorge Rodrigues, Lieutenant-General Commander-in-Chief of the Army.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel.\n\nThe friend is João Silveira. The lieutenant presented is João Ferreira to Lieutenant-Colonel Francisco Pedro. It appears to refer again to Loureiro according to the examination that was carried by the bearer of the letter."
