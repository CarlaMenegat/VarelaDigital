  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency that Neto was in São José gathering men to attack and persecute me, a police force which I had placed in Encruzilhada; I hastened to gather some horsemen and pursue them, traveling by night and ambushing along their paths, which allowed me to reach São José without being detected by the enemy’s vanguards; but I did not find him there as he had passed Camaquã and proceeded to Piratini. Yesterday a friend of mine arrived from outside who left Colonel Loureiro at the chapel of Santana with 900 men to join with Aníbal, who had 200 men, and the next day they were to unite and then intended to pursue Guedes, who was nearby with 500 men and had killed some rebel officers who were holding meetings for the rebels; a lieutenant from the rebels had defected, and many horses and men have been gathered.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency. Cordilheira, July 3, 1840. Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir Manuel Jorge Rodrigues, Lieutenant-General Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Francisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel.\n\nThe friend is João Silveira. The Lieutenant presented is João Ferreira to Lieutenant-Colonel Francisco Pedro. It seems to refer again to Loureiro according to the examination that was delivered with the official letter."
