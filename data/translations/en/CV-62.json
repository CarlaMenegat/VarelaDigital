  "translation": "I participate in Your Excellency. Neto was in São José gathering people to beat me and pursue me to a police station I had set up in Encruzilhada. I tried to gather some cavalry and pursue them, walking at night and ambushing their movements, which allowed me to reach São José without being noticed by the enemy's advance; but I did not find him there as he had already passed Camaquã and gone on to Piratini. Yesterday, a friend of mine from outside arrived, who left Colonel Loureiro at the chapel of Santana with 900 men to meet with Aníbal, who was gathering 200 men the next day and then intended to pursue Guedes, who was nearby with 500 men and had killed some rebel officers who were having meetings for the rebels; a lieutenant from the rebels defected and has gathered many horses and people."
