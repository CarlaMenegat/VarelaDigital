  "translation": "My dear Bernardina\n\nPedras Brancas, March 6, 1836.\n\nI have constantly written to you by couriers to the army, and what are my afflictions and cares for not receiving a letter from you since the 6th of last month? You, surrounded by those fierce people, whose nature was clearly shown in the time of Braga; the wife of a man to whom they have given the greatest rancor; how could you fail to be troubled? These are the reflections that torment me; and even more so when I am convinced that the unworthy ones to whom, to my greatest torment, I am indebted, will not miss such an opportune occasion to do what they shamelessly intended when I was imprisoned. Be that as it may, have perseverance, and despise the indignities of these slaves, who will never see me (thus I confide in God) reduced to the state they wish me, etc., etc... Let us come to what matters. Send me at the first opportunity a courier informing me about you, our children, and our home, not hiding from me the most insignificant circumstance that might have happened since the declaration of war by Ceroula and his followers; and compadre José Félix should do me this favor. Compadre Rolino should also come, as I have already ordered him, and for now you suspend your coming.\n\nI have already finalized the lease of the establishment I told you about, and it is to leave it in order and running that I need to speak to compadre Rolino.\n\nHelplessly I am going to Rio to impose upon the Regent of the state of our Province and what it lacks so that it is not lost to Brazil and perhaps to himself: you can judge the violence I do to myself by separating from you and our dear little children, and by going to get lost in the horde of scoundrels who have left here; but when the Fatherland calls for our services, everything else is set aside. God help me. Have patience Bernardina: this cannot last forever, and one day we will enjoy peace. São Lourenço, whom you will ask to send to João Gonçalves da Silva, to whom you should also write; from there to the Justice of Peace of Dores; from there to José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim, in such a way that the latter sends me the letter; I believe you have already understood, although I have explained myself poorly. I live desperate for lack of news from home, and without it I will not leave for Rio, come what may. I myself wanted to make a quick trip there, but remembering the fugitives and strayed who have been doing all the harm and even some revenge I might take in the force of some anger, I give up on that trip. I send you 35$ réis, which is what I had in my pocket, for not knowing of this own courier.\n\nRead and have Chaves and ours read this letter and the copy of the official document, and then seal them and send to their destination. If there is any officer there with our people, send him the letter open as it is, and he shall send it by a soldier.\n\nHugs and kisses to our children, whom you will likewise bless for me. Recommendations to the godmother, to compadre Chastan, to whom you will also show Bento's letter, to compadre José Félix, to Chaves and to all the others.\n\nYours,\n\nAlmeida"
