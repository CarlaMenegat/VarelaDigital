  "translation": "My dear Bernardina  \nPedras Brancas, March 6, 1836.\n\nI have constantly written to you by couriers to the army, and what are my afflictions and cares for not receiving a letter from you since the 6th of last month? You, surrounded by those fierce people, whose nature was quite evident in the time of Braga; the wife of a man to whom they have shown the greatest rancor; how could you fail to be troubled? These are the reflections that torment me; and even more so when I am convinced that the unworthy ones to whom, to my greatest torment, I am indebted, will not miss such a timely occasion to do what they shamelessly intended when I was imprisoned. Whatever it may be, be steadfast, and despise the indignities of these slaves, who will never see me (so I entrust it to God) reduced to the state they wish for me, etc., etc. Let us go to what matters. Send me at the first opportunity a courier informing me about you, our children, and our home, not concealing any insignificant circumstance that may have occurred, since the declaration of war by Ceroula and his followers; and let godfather José Félix do me this favor. Godfather Rolino should also come as I have already ordered, and for now you suspend your coming.\n\nI have already finalized the lease of the establishment I told you about, and it is to leave it in order and running that I need to speak with godfather Rolino.\n\nUntil then I must go to Rio to impose on the Regent of the state of our Province and on what it lacks so as not to be lost to Brazil and maybe to himself as well: you can judge the violence I do to myself by leaving you and our dear little children and going to plunge into the horde of scoundrels that have left here; but when the Fatherland demands our services, everything else is set aside. God help me. Have patience, Bernardina: this will not last forever, and one day we will enjoy peace. São Lourenço, whom you will ask to send to João Gonçalves da Silva, to whom you should also write similarly; then to the Justice of the Peace of Dores; then to José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim, so that the latter sends me the letter; I think you have already understood, although I have explained it poorly. I live in despair for lack of news from home, and without it I will not leave for Rio, come what may. I would like to make a little trip there myself, but remembering the fugitives and lost people who have been doing all the harm and even some revenge that I might take in the heat of some rage, I desist from this journey. I send you 35 reis which is what I brought in my pocket, for not knowing of this courier.\n\nRead and have Chaves and our people read this letter and the copy of the official document, and then seal them and send to their destination. If there is an officer there with our people, send him the letter open as it is, and let him send it by a soldier.\n\nHugs and kisses to our children whom you will also bless for me. Recommendations to the godmother, godfather Chastan, to whom you will also show Bento’s letter, to godfather José Félix, Chaves, and all the others.\n\nYours,  \nAlmeida"
