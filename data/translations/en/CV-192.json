  "translation": "I have constantly written to you through the own messenger to the army, expressing my afflictions and concerns about not receiving a letter from you since the 6th of last month. You are surrounded by that ferocious people, whose nature was clearly revealed during the time of Braga; a woman of a man whom they have directed the greatest hatred towards; how can you avoid being troubled? These are the reflections that torment me; even more so when I am convinced that the unworthy individuals to whom I am indebted, to my greater torment, will not miss such an opportune occasion to do what they shamelessly intended when I was imprisoned. But whatever it may be, remain steadfast, and disregard the indignities of those slaves, for they will never see me (so I trust in God) reduced to the state they wish for me, etc., etc...\n\nLet’s get to what matters. Send me a messenger at the first opportunity with news of you, our children, and our home, not withholding the most insignificant circumstance that may have occurred since the declaration of war by Ceroula and his followers; and ask Comrade José Félix to do me this favor. Comrade Rolino should also come as I have already ordered, and for now you should suspend your coming.\n\nI have finalized the lease for the establishment I mentioned to you, and it is to leave it in order and functioning that I need to speak to Comrade Rolino.\n\nWithout remedy, I proceed to Rio to impose upon the Regent of our Province the things it needs not to be lost to Brazil and perhaps to itself: you can judge the violence I do to myself in separating from you and our dear little ones and in plunging into the horde of scoundrels who have left here; but when the homeland calls for our services, everything else is set aside. May God help me. Be patient, Bernardina: this will not last forever, and one day we will enjoy some peace. São Lourenço, to whom you will ask to send to João Gonçalves da Silva to whom you should also write; from there to the Justice of the Peace of Dores; from this one to José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim, so that the latter will send me the letter for myself; I believe you already understood, since I might have explained poorly. I live in despair due to the lack of news from home, and without it, I will not leave for Rio, whatever it may take. I would like to make a trip there myself, but remembering the fugitives and those lost who are doing all the harm and even of some revenge I could take in a fit of anger, I give up that journey. I am sending you 35$ réis, which is what I have in my pocket, not knowing of this messenger.\n\nRead and have Chaves and our people read this letter and a copy of the official document, and then seal them and send them to their destination. If there is any officer with our men there, send him the letter open as it is, and let him send it by a soldier.\n\nHugs and kisses to our children, whom you will also bless for me. Recommendations to the comadre, to Comrade Chastan, to whom you will also show the letter from Bento, to Comrade José Félix, Chaves, and all the others."
