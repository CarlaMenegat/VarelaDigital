  "translation": "My dear Bernardina Pedras Brancas, March 6, 1836.\n\nI have constantly written to you by the army messengers, and what are my afflictions and cares for not receiving a letter from you since the 6th of last month? You surrounded by those fierce people, whose nature was quite evident in the time of Braga; the wife of a man to whom they have shown the greatest rancor; how could you not be troubled? These are the reflections that torment me; and even more when I am convinced that the unworthy ones to whom, to my greatest torment, I am indebted, will not miss such an opportune occasion to do what they shamelessly intended when I was imprisoned. However, whatever it may be, have endurance, and despise the indignities of these slaves, who will never see me (thus I entrust to God) reduced to the state they wish for me, etc., etc... Let us come to what matters. Send me at the first opportunity a messenger giving me news of you, our children, and our household, not hiding the most insignificant circumstance that may have occurred since the declaration of war by Ceroula and his followers; and make the godfather José Félix do me this favor. The godfather Rolino should also come as I have already ordered him, and for now suspend your arrival.\n\nI have already finalized the lease of the establishment I told you about, and it is to leave it in order and running that I need to speak to godfather Rolino.\n\nWith no other option, I go to Rio to impose on the Regent of our Province the state and what it lacks so as not to be lost to Brazil and perhaps to himself: you can judge the violence I do to myself in separating from you and our dear children, and going to mingle with the horde of scoundrels who have left here; but when the Fatherland calls for our services, everything else is set aside. God help me. Have patience Bernardina: this will not last forever, and one day we will enjoy peace. São Lourenço, to whom you will ask to send to João Gonçalves da Silva, to whom you must likewise write; then to the Justice of the Peace of Dores; from there to José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim, so that the latter sends me the letter; I believe you have already understood, although I have explained poorly. I live desperate for lack of news from home, and without it I will not leave for Rio, come what may. I would like myself to take a trip there, but remembering the fugitives and the strayed ones who have been causing all the harm and even some vengeance I could take in the force of some anger, I give up that journey. I send you 35 réis which is what I had on me, for not knowing of this messenger.\n\nRead and have the Chaves and ours read this letter and a copy of the official letter, then seal them and send to their destination. If there is an officer there with our men, send him the open letter as it is, and let him send it by a soldier.\n\nHugs and kisses to our children whom you will also bless for me. Greetings to the godmother, to the godfather Chastan to whom you will also show Bento's letter, to godfather José Félix, Chaves and all the others.\n\nYours, Almeida"
