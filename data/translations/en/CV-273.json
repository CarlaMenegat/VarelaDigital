  "translation": "My President Piratini, December 10, 1838.\n\nSend me the ounces I requested; it is enough that you send me only sixty ounces, so that I may immediately make them enter and leave the Treasury for Matos and Antônio Gonçalves, who already want them for travel arrangements; and I promised to send them to you.\n\nFrom Your Excellency, Almeida"
