  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart. Bordo, October 8, 1835.\n\nYesterday I received the comfort of your letter; but I must say that, despite appearances, I live almost in despair... You know the repugnance I have for the sea; however, if it is your will, I want to go to Rio. Therefore, send me your orders and my clothes to be delivered to the Senhor. Arm yourself with patience, I recommend you once again; there is your father, who will not abandon you, and leave it to time to clarify so many mysteries. Ask the Senhor to obtain the letter I addressed to compadre Belchior; keep the judge’s office document, letters from Mateus and Viana, as well as a correspondence I had withdrawn, and come with the answer from the “Redator”: for all of it will serve for my defense. For clothing, a tailcoat is enough, the robissão made of cloth, the two made of chintz, all white and black trousers, white and black socks, shirts, and hat.\n\nHugs to all of ours; and farewell, my dear Bernardina. Your husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nChaves is to consider this his; João da Cunha is to take care of those receipts and deliver them, thanking for these favors. Cousin Cipriano is to consider this his and to write to Pimenta to supply me with some money if it is for Rio: and to take care of the house, please. Do not show this letter to anyone and make the recommendations orally.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Costa Pelotas."
