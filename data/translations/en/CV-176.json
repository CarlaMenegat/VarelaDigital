  "translation": "Yesterday I received the comfort of your letter; but I must say that, despite appearances, I live in almost despair... You know the repugnance I have for the sea; however, if it is your will, I want to head to Rio. So send me your orders and have my clothes delivered to the Senhor. Dress yourself in patience, I recommend you again; there is your father, who will not leave you without support, and let time clarify so many mysteries. Ask the Senhor to obtain the letter I directed to compadre Belchior; keep the office of the judge, letters from Mateus and Viana, as well as correspondence that I had removed, and comes with the response from the \"Editor\": for everything will serve for my defense. In the clothes, just a frock coat, the muslin robe, the two in chita, all the white and black trousers, white and black stockings, shirts and hat.\n\nKeys to have this for yourself; João da Cunha should take hold of those receipts and deliver them, thanking for these favors. Cousin Cipriano should take this for himself and write to Pimenta to provide me with some money if it is for Rio: and please take care of the house.\n\nDo not show this letter to anyone and make the recommendations orally."
