  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart. Bordo, October 8, 1835.\n\nYesterday I received the comfort of your letter; but I must say that, despite appearances, I live almost in despair... You know the aversion I have to the sea; however, if it is your wish, I want to go to Rio. Therefore, send me your orders and my clothes to be delivered to the Senhor. Arm yourself with patience, I recommend it to you again; there is your father, who will not forsake you, and let time clarify so many mysteries. Ask Senhor to obtain the letter I addressed to compadre Belchior; keep the official document from the judge, letters from Mateus and from Viana, as well as a correspondence I had withdrawn and come with the response from the “Redator”: for everything will serve for my defense. For the clothes, one coat is enough, the robissão of cloth, the two calico ones, all the white and black pants, white and black socks, shirts, and hat.\n\nHugs to all our people; and farewell, my dear Bernardina. Your husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nKeys that belong to her; João da Cunha to take care of these receipts and deliver them thanking for these favors. Cousin Cipriano to consider it as his own and to write to Pimenta to supply me with some money if it is for Rio: and to look after the house, please. Do not show this letter to anyone, and make the recommendations verbally.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Costa Pelotas."
