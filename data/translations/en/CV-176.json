  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart. Bordo, October 8, 1835.\n\nYesterday I received the comfort of your letter; but I must say that, despite appearances, I live almost in despair... You know the aversion I have to the sea; however, if it is your wish, I want to go to Rio. Therefore send me your orders and my clothes to be delivered to Senhor. Endure with patience, I recommend to you again; there is your father, who will not abandon you, and leave it to time to clarify so many mysteries. Ask the Senhor to obtain the letter I sent to compadre Belchior; keep the judge’s official document, letters from Mateus and from Viana, as well as a correspondence I had withdrawn and come back with the answer from the “Redator”: for all will serve for my defense. Regarding clothes, one coat is enough, the robisson of cloth, the two from chintz, all the white and black trousers, white and black socks, shirts and hat.\n\nHugs to all our dear ones; and farewell, my dear Bernardina. Your husband of the heart, Almeida.\n\nKeys that this should be for his; João da Cunha who should take note of these receipts and deliver them thanking for these favors. Cousin Cipriano who should take care of this and write to Pimenta to provide me with some money if it is to Rio: and to take care of the house please. Do not show this letter to anyone and give the recommendations orally.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Costa Pelotas."
