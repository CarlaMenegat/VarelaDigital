  "translation": "Dear friend; Your esteemed letters, delivered to me by D. Inácio Nobre, have given me satisfaction, for through one of them I see that Your Excellency, at 9 o'clock at night, experienced an uprising from some Santafesinos, in very small numbers, who owed their salvation to the darkness of night. According to all instructions, they have marched to this part where I hope Your Excellency Bagé. Upon my entry into this department, the leader Dionísio Coronel, with 200 rebels, crossed the Jaguarão at Francisquito; and as a consequence, he will prepare on the other side to trouble us again while we are occupied with a strong army in front of us, and since this occurrence will delay the service that I and Your Excellency Jaguarão will carry out with your force, where cattle and horses will be found, being I responsible for the results of this operation, provided that neither Dionísio nor Borges pass through here."
