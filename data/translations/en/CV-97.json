  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir Camilo dos Santos Campelo.\n\nDear friend; Your valuable letters, which were delivered to me by D. Inácio Nobre, have given me satisfaction, for by one of them I see that Your Lordship, on the 20th, at 9 o'clock in the evening, there was an uprising of some very few Santafesinos, who owed their salvation to the darkness of the night. According to all the reports, they marched in this direction, whence I expect Your Lordship Bagé. Upon my arrival in this department, the leader Dionísio Coronel, with 200 rebels, crossed the Jaguarão at Francisquito; and as is to be expected, preparations will be made on the other side to trouble us again when we are engaged with a strong army before us, and as this occurrence will delay the service to which I and Your Lordship Jaguarão with his force, whence he will find cattle and horses, being responsible for the results of this operation, with the condition that neither Dionísio nor Borges pass through here.\n\nI take this opportunity to reiterate myself to Your Lordship Félix Eduardo Aguiar.\n\nIt is as agreed. Camilo Campelo"
