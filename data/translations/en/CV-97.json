  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir Camilo dos Santos Campelo.\n\nDear friend; Your esteemed letters, which D. Inácio Nobre delivered to me, have given me satisfaction, for in one of them I see that Your Lordship, at 9 o’clock at night on the 20th, there was an uprising by some Santafesinos, in very small number, who owed their salvation to the darkness of the night. According to all reports, they have marched towards this area from where I expect Your Lordship Bagé. Upon my arrival in this department, the leader Dionísio Coronel, with 200 rebels, crossed the Jaguarão at Francisquito; and as is to be expected, he will prepare on the other side to harass us again when we are occupied with a strong army in front of us, and as this occurrence will delay the service to which I and Your Lordship Jaguarão with your force, from where you will find cattle and horses, being I responsible for the results of this operation, provided that neither Dionísio nor Borges pass through here.\n\nI take this occasion to reiterate myself to Your Lordship Félix Eduardo Aguiar.\n\nIt is in accordance. Camilo Campelo"
