  "translation": "Most illustrious Sir Camilo dos Santos Campelo.\n\nDear friend; Your valued letters, which were delivered to me by D. Inácio Nobre, have given me satisfaction, for in one of them I see that Your Excellency, on the 20th, at 9 at night, there was a revolt by some people from Santa Fe, in very small number, who owed their salvation to the darkness of the night. According to all instructions, they have marched to this part, from where I hope Your Excellency will Bagé. Upon my arrival in this department, the leader Dionísio Coronel, with 200 rebels, crossed the Jaguarão at Francisquito; and as is natural, he will prepare, on the other side, to harass us again when we are occupied with a strong army in front of us, and as this occurrence will delay the service to which I and Your Excellency Jaguarão with your force, from where you will find cattle and horses, being responsible for the results of this operation, provided that neither Dionísio nor Borges pass through here.\n\nI take this occasion to repeat myself to Your Excellency Félix Eduardo Aguiar.\n\nIt is so agreed. Camilo Campelo"
