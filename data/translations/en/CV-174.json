Porto Alegre, June 20, 1835.\n\nThank God now, 5 o'clock in the afternoon, our legislative work is over, and by the first vessel, you will have me there, if no unforeseen obstacle prevents it.\n\nHugs to our children and greetings to your parents, godfather José Félix, your brothers, José Pedro, João da Cunha and everyone at home, receiving the heart of your old lover Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. City of Pelotas."
