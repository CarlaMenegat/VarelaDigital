  "translation": "Dear Bernardina\n\nPorto Alegre, February 16, 1836.\n\nThe Assembly and this entire city being in expectation of Araújo Ribeiro to take office and see if thus the storm that he and a riffraff from Rio Grande and the North had conjured against this beautiful Province would dissipate, news arrives by mail that far from coming Araújo was taking all measures to stir up the fiercest anarchy, brandishing the flag of civil war; and shortly thereafter similar news arrived, proclamations and intercepted official letters confirming all that was told to us from Rio Grande and the North; and even more, that from Santa Catarina and the Cisplatina, with Silva Tavares, that monster awaits troops to shed our blood. Learned by experience, I lament a struggle that has to stain our fields and villages, due to the exaltation of the parties that will know no limits... And although we already have more than four thousand brave men under arms decided to die or save the Fatherland, and I do not doubt for a moment the triumph of the national party, I am also convinced that my existence there will bring you continual afflictions, by the snares that those people who think differently can lay for me, who make war on me just as much as you know better than anyone. Also to you it is not unknown that our fortune there could never advance a small step, due to the diversion they even give to the cattle they want to give me on the side. Under such circumstances the present state of affairs, our business, your peace and many other considerations prudently advise that we must without hesitation leave this place, at least for a few years. You know how much I love this establishment, which I regard as my child that I saw born and develop; but I must sacrifice afflictions, and look solely to you and to our children, etc., etc. According to my orders I suppose you are on your way here; but if incidents have delayed you I want you to verify this at the first suitable opportunity, bringing in your company everything you can, for which you will charter the necessary yachts. You will leave in the small farm only one slave to take care of the ditches, weed the feet of the groves, keep standing not only those fences but most of the paddocks and around the house, so that they are not damaged. The tack room utensils must come; the salt that is measured and Chevalier to keep it; the horses and tame livestock to come by land if possible; and godfather Rolino if he could even come here as overseer, would be excellent. Chevalier will arrange this, to be responsible for the lease. The dried meat house and possibly the house perhaps Felizardo, or cousin Cipriano may want to rent.\n\nAs I said, here we can make a fortune; because if I am not allowed to raise a single cent, I cannot buy herds of account, and if they do not give me supports, the dried meat house cannot work; and here at least a lot of tile and brick are made, perhaps you will find means to constantly pay the account of the support as soon as it is known that my factory is well set up and can produce continuously, because it has slaves, which is not the case of the other dried meat houses that being supported by indigenous people mostly fail, and now with these movements they are armed, etc., etc.\n\nFinally, I proposed this to see you, at least for some time, with your spirit at rest, having we the fortune of the company of our good godfather José Félix, who besides directs our dear children; and to find it open for, in retirement, to withdraw slowly from the political world.\n\nFarewell my dear Bernardina. Regards to our children, to godfather José Félix and your parents, remembrance to José Pedro, to your brothers, to godfather Rolino and to João da Cunha, receiving you the heart of\n\nYours,\n\nAlmeida\n\nLady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida\n\nPelotas"
