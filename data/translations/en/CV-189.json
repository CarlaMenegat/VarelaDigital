  "translation": "Dear Bernardina,\n\nPorto Alegre, February 16, 1836.\n\nWith the Assembly and this entire city waiting for Araújo Ribeiro to take office and see if thus the storm that he and other rabble from Rio Grande and Norte had conjured against this beautiful Province would dissipate, news arrives by mail that far from coming Araújo was taking every measure to incite the fiercest anarchy, shaking the brand of civil war; and soon after similar news came proclamations and intercepted documents confirming what was told to us from Rio Grande and Norte; and even more, that from Santa Catarina and the Cisplatina, with Silva Tavares, that monster awaits troops to spill our blood. \n\nMastered by experience, I lament a struggle that will have to stain our fields and villages, due to the exaltation of parties that will know no limits... And although we already have more than four thousand brave men under arms decided to die or save the Fatherland, and I do not doubt for an instant the triumph of the national party, I am also convinced that my existence there will bring you continuous afflictions, due to the traps that these people, thinking differently, may lay for me, who make war on me as much as you know better than anyone. \n\nAlso, you are not unaware that our fortune there can never advance a small step, because of the diversion they make even of the cattle they want to provide me for grazing. Under such circumstances, the current state of affairs, our business, your peace of mind, and many other considerations prudently advise that we must without hesitation leave, at least for a few years, this place. You know how much I love this establishment, which I look upon as my child that I saw born and grow; but I must sacrifice afflictions and look solely to you and our children, etc., etc.\n\nAccording to my orders, I must suppose you are on your way here; however, if incidents have delayed you, I want you to check at the first favorable opportunity, bringing in your company everything you can, for which you will charter the necessary yachts. You will leave only one slave at the farm to tend the ditches, hoe the foot of the groves, maintain not only those fences but most of the paddocks and the house grounds, so that they do not become damaged. The hardware of the smithy must come; the salt should be measured and Chevalier is to keep it; the horses and tame cattle should come by land if possible; and the compadre Rolino, if he could come here even as overseer, would be excellent. Chevalier will arrange that, to answer for the lease. The drying house and the house perhaps Felizardo, or cousin Cipriano, might want to lease.\n\nAs I said, we can make a fortune there; because without a cent allowed me, I cannot buy respectable cattle, and without grazing allowed, the drying house cannot work; and here, at least, a great deal of tile and brick is made, perhaps you will find means to keep a constant grazing account as soon as it becomes known that my factory is well set up and can kill at any time, having slaves, which does not happen with the other drying houses, which being grazed with Indians, most of the time fail, and now with these movements are armed, etc., etc.\n\nFinally, I propose this to see you at least for some time with your spirit at rest, having us the fortune of the company of our good compadre José Félix, who besides directs our beloved children; and to find it open to retreat and slip away from the political world.\n\nFarewell, my dear Bernardina. Hugs to our children, compadre José Félix and your parents, regards to José Pedro, your siblings, compadre Rolino and João da Cunha, you receiving the heart of yours, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida.\n\nPelotas."
