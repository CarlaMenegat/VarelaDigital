  "translation": "While the Assembly and all this city awaited Araújo Ribeiro to take office and see if the storm he and more cohorts from Rio Grande and the North had conjured against this beautiful Province would thus evaporate, news came by mail that far from coming, Araújo was taking all measures to incite the fiercest anarchy, shaking the brand of civil war; and shortly after similar news came proclamations and letters that were intercepted, confirming what we were told from Rio Grande and the North; and furthermore, from Santa Catarina and Cisplatina, with Silva Tavares, this monster awaited troops to spill our blood. Master by experience, I lament a struggle that must stain our fields and towns, by the exaltation of the parties that will know no limits... And although we already have more than four thousand brave men in arms, determined to die or save the Fatherland, and I do not doubt for an instant the triumph of the national party, I am also convinced that my existence there will bring you continual distress, due to the traps that these people, who think differently than I, may set for me, as you know better than anyone. It is also not unknown to you that our fortunes there can never take even a small step forward, due to the diversion they give even to the cattle that they want to provide me for expenses. In such circumstances, the current state of affairs, our business, your peace of mind, and many other considerations prudently advise that we should without hesitation abandon that place, at least for a few years. You know how much I love this establishment, which I view as my child that I have seen born and grow; but I must sacrifice my distress and look only to you and our children, etc., etc. According to my orders, I must assume you are on your way here; however, if incidents have delayed it, I want you to verify it at the first suitable opportunity, bringing with you everything you can, for which you will charter the necessary yachts. You will leave a slave at the farm only to take care of the ditches, hoe the bases of the trees, and maintain not only those fences but most of the pastures and those around the house, so that they do not become damaged. The utensils from the tanning should come; the salt that is measured and Chevalier who will preserve it; the riding horses and gentle cattle that should come overland as much as possible; and if compadre Rolino could come here as a foreman, it would be excellent. Chevalier, arrange this to be responsible for the leasing. Perhaps Felizardo, or cousin Cipriano, would want to lease the charqueada and house.\n\nAs I said, there we can make a fortune; because if I cannot glean a penny, I cannot buy cattle of worth, and if I am not given expenses, the charqueada cannot operate; and here at least a lot of tile and brick is made, perhaps you will find means to pay expenses regularly as soon as it is clear that my factory is well set up and can operate at any time, having slaves, which does not happen with the other charqueadas, which being funded by Indians, most of the time fail, and now with these movements are armed, etc., etc.\n\nFinally, I set out for this to see you, at least for some time, with your spirit at rest, having the fortune of the company of our good compadre José Félix, who besides directs our dear children; and to find it open to, in retirement, slip away from the political world."
