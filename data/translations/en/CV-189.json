  "translation": "Dear Bernardina\n\nPorto Alegre, February 16, 1836.\n\nWith the Assembly and the whole city awaiting Araújo Ribeiro to take office and to see if thus the storm that he and a raiding party from Rio Grande and Norte had conjured against this beautiful Province would dissipate, news arrives by mail that instead of coming, Araújo was making all preparations to stir up the fiercest anarchy, shaking the torch of civil war; and soon after similar news comes proclamations and intercepted official letters confirming all that was told to us from Rio Grande and Norte; and moreover, that from Santa Catarina and the Cisplatina, with Silva Tavares, that monster waits for troops to shed our blood. Experienced as I am, I lament a struggle that must stain our fields and villages, due to the exaltation of factions that will know no limits... And although already armed we have more than four thousand brave men decided either to die or to save the Fatherland, and I do not doubt for a moment the triumph of the national party, I am also convinced that my existence there will bring you continuous afflictions, due to the traps these people may set me, who think differently and make war on me as much as you know better than anyone. Also known to you is that our fortune there has never been able to advance even a small step because of the diversions they even give to the cattle that they want to set as boundary for me. Under such circumstances, the current state of affairs, our business, your peace, and many other considerations prudently advise that we must without hesitation leave this place at least for a few years. You know how much I love this establishment, which I look upon as my child whom I saw born and develop; but I must sacrifice afflictions and look solely to you and our children, etc., etc.\n\nAccording to my orders, I suppose you are on your way here; however, if incidents have delayed you, I want you to verify it at the first suitable occasion, bringing in your company everything you can, for which you will charter the necessary yachts. You will leave only one slave at the small farm to take care of the ditches, hoe the bases of the trees, preserve standing not only those fences but most of the paddocks and the house grounds so that they do not get damaged. The tools of the grease room must come; the salt that is measured and Chevalier to preserve it; the horses and tame cattle to come by land if possible; and if godfather Rolino could come here even as foreman, it would be wonderful. Chevalier will arrange that, to answer for the lease. Perhaps Felizardo or cousin Cipriano would want to lease the drying yard and the house.\n\nAs I said, fortune can be made there; because if I am not allowed even a penny in credit, I cannot buy good cattle, and if no credit is given me, the drying yard cannot work; here at least much tile and brick are made, you might find means to keep constant credit going as soon as it is known that my factory is well established and can operate at any hour by having slaves, which is not the case with other drying yards, which being run with Indians, mostly fail, and now with these movements are armed, etc., etc.\n\nFinally, I proposed this so as to see you, at least for some time, with your spirit at rest, having the fortune of the company of our good godfather José Félix, who also takes care of our dear children; and to find it open so that, in retirement, I may slip away from the political world.\n\nFarewell my dear Bernardina. Hugs to our children, to godfather José Félix and your parents, regards to José Pedro, to your brothers, to godfather Rolino and to João da Cunha, receiving you the heart of\n\nYours, Almeida\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida.\n\nPelotas."
