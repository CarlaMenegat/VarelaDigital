  "translation": "Today at around 5 o'clock in the morning, our enemies entered the chapel of Santa Maria, coming from Cima da Serra. Wanting to scout their strength, I sent Lieutenant José Jacinto with 5 men, and in the first shots, he was killed. After observing the enemy's strength, I withdrew with 10 men, which was all I had. On the same date, I reported to the Most Illustrious Mr. João Antônio, informing him of the incident; the force I could observe numbered around a hundred men. I remain at this point, paying attention to the enemy's movements."
