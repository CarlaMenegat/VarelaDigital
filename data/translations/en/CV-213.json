  "translation": "Piratini, May 29, 1837 — 2nd of Independence and the Republic.\n\nIt is fitting to promptly promote, within and outside the State, a loan of three hundred contos de réis in hard currency to meet the expenses of the defensive war honorably sustained by the valiant inhabitants of the Rio-Grandense Republic, against the oppressive and unjust government of Rio de Janeiro, the President of the same Republic decrees:\n\nArticle 1 — The Minister and Secretary of State for the Affairs of the Treasury is authorized to contract, within and outside the State, a loan of three hundred contos de réis in hard currency.\n\nArticle 2 — The loaned capital will yield interest of one and a half percent per month, or less if possible.\n\nArticle 3 — The interest referred to in the preceding article, plus ten percent more for gradual amortization of the capital, shall be inexorably paid at the end of each year, until the full repayment of the loan mentioned in Article One, which shall not exceed the term of ten years, counted from the day the loaned amounts enter the Treasury.\n\nArticle 4 — Since it is to be expected that the state of the Treasury will soon be in a position to meet all the expenses of the State, not only by the austere method of oversight to be established in the Treasury Departments, but also by their fair economy, if such a case arises the total sum of the loan and accrued premiums will be paid at the end of six years, counted from the date of this decree.\n\nArticle 5 — In addition to the State's revenues, the following national assets are mortgaged to the repayment of this loan: Rincão de Saicã; that of El Rei in Rio Pardo; the Campo de Bojuru; that of the Countess of Real Agrado in Jaguarão; the farms of the extinct Missions; and all unoccupied lands still existing in the State.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida, Minister and Secretary of State for the Affairs of the Treasury, shall understand this accordingly and execute it with the necessary dispatches.
