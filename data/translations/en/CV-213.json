  "translation": "Considering the immediate promotion, both within and outside the State, of a loan of three hundred contos de réis in strong currency to cover the expenses of the defensive war that the brave inhabitants of the Republic of Rio Grande do Sul nobly sustain against the oppressive and unjust government of Rio de Janeiro, the President of the same Republic decrees:\n\nArticle 1. — The Minister and Secretary of State for the Affairs of Finance is authorized to contract, within and outside the State, a loan of three hundred contos de réis in strong currency.\n\nArticle 2. — The borrowed capital will bear interest of one and a half percent per month, or even less if possible.\n\nArticle 3. — The interest mentioned in the preceding article, along with ten percent more for the gradual amortization of the capital, shall be paid inevitably at the end of each year, until the complete reimbursement of the loan referred to in the first article, which shall not exceed a term of ten years, counted from the day the borrowed amounts enter the Treasury.\n\nArticle 4. — Given that it is expected that the state of the Treasury will soon be in a position to cover all State expenses, not only through the austere method of oversight that will be established in the Finance Departments, but also in their just economy, if this is the case, the total sum of the loan and accrued premiums will be paid at the end of six years, counted from the date of this decree.\n\nArticle 5. — In addition to the income of the State, the following national properties are mortgaged to the reimbursement of this loan: Rincão de Saicã; El Rei in Rio Pardo; the Campo de Bojuru; that of the Countess of Real Agrado in Jaguarão; the estates of the extinct Missions; and all unoccupied lands that still exist in the State.\n\nDomingos José de Almeida, Minister and Secretary of State for the Affairs of Finance, shall thus understand and execute with the necessary dispatches. José Gomes de Vasconcelos Jardim. Domingos José de Almeida. Let it be published and registered. Piratini, May 29, 1837. Almeida."
