  "translation": "I hold in my possession, after having been presented to the government, the two letters from Your Excellency dated the 15th of the current month, to which I am compelled to respond that Lieutenant José Antônio de Faria will proceed with what he has done regarding Your Excellency's request, Your Excellency Cachoeira, and as he will have one or two more days of delay, I hope that Your Excellency Trem, and for this reason, Your Excellency Rio Pardo will not be bringing over there a portion of cloth, which, going to the army, could not advance, which will be applied to the strength of your command."
