  "translation": "Most Illustrious Sir\n\nThe two letters from Your Lordship dated the 15th of the current month remain in my possession after having been presented to the government, and to which I am able to respond that Lieutenant José Antônio de Faria will proceed with what has been done regarding Your Lordship's requisition to Your Lordship Cachoeira; and since he will have a delay of one or two more days, I hope that Your Lordship Trem, and for this reason Your Lordship Rio Pardo will not bring from there any portion of cloth, which, going to the army, could not advance, which will be applied to the force under your command.\n\nGod preserve Your Lordship  \nSecretariat of War Affairs in Caçapava, March 19, 1840.  \nMost Illustrious Sir Colonel João Antônio da Silveira.  \nSerafim Joaquim de Alencastre"
