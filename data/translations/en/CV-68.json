  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn compliance with the orders I received from Your Excellency on the 20th of this month, I crossed São Gonçalo with the force I brought from Porto Alegre, and Major Antunes with twenty men, including some officers, and Captain Lucas with two comrades who volunteered to go out; and as news spread that Neto was already waiting for me with more than a thousand men, I requisitioned from the Most Excellent Rio Grande the 8th Battalion to leave at a support point so I could reconnoiter the force, since I could not find a single firefighter; and marching towards the chapel of Canguçu, where Bento Gonçalves was with over two hundred men and some senior officers of the Republic, no matter how much effort I made, I could not get through unnoticed because it was a very populated area and all ragged; as soon as Bento Gonçalves received news of my march to that village, he gathered everyone and began to retreat; seeing that I could do nothing against him as he was already prepared and my cavalry was very poor, I arranged to feed my men and rest the horses, ordering the 8th Battalion I had left as support at Ricardo's pottery to withdraw to the Liscano crossing, and sent Major Antunes and Captain Lucas back with the enlisted men they had brought, and while I was retreating, showing great fear and caution towards Bento Gonçalves and Neto, marching all night and at dawn, on the dawn of the 24th Bento Gonçalves caught up with me on the Guatimim trails; having left an ambush in the rear to reconnoiter the force, a large force was seen coming on the said trails; in this reconnaissance I lost one soldier killed and one mortally wounded; I withdrew again to see if I could regulate the number of forces and as there was no arroyo Grande, I advanced Captain Isaías with over fifty men to gather horses on the left bank of the Camaquã, to see if something could be done since my cavalry gave me no courage to undertake anything; dawn broke at the Camaquã crossing at Mendonça, I realized the enemy was coming cautiously because they had left part of their cavalry behind; I crossed Camaquã to this side, had the residents state that I was coming very afraid of Neto, who they spread was following in the rear, and at 6 p.m. I began to withdraw; as soon as it grew dark I sent the cavalry with 60 men to the Cordeiro crossing and I with the main force counter-marched backwards and, ambushing myself near the said crossing, positioned the infantry under the command of Major Queste on the trail, ordering him to let pass between 150 and 200 men and fire on their rear so that I could charge in front; at dawn on the 26th, Bento Gonçalves set off along the trail of the said crossing, and the Major, letting the indicated force pass, fired on their rear, but as it had rained all night and the weapons were wet, they passed again to the other side, leaving 5 dead and about forty saddled horses. Seeing that they had formed on the other side, I sent the infantry forward and crossed with the cavalry behind; seeing that I did not pass with more than two hundred cavalrymen, Bento Gonçalves set out to attack me, and as soon as he saw me separated from the infantry, he charged me with over three hundred men; but his superiority in force did not avail him, as he was completely defeated, leaving 31 dead on the field and twenty prisoners, including a lieutenant colonel and a lieutenant, the latter among the dead, and two hundred horses, more than eighty saddled, many of them Captain Antônio Cândido da Silva and the brave Ensign Pedro Antônio Iripi and the valiant Sergeant Antônio Correia, who were immortalized in battle, and seven wounded soldiers, four seriously and three lightly, two of them infantry among the seriously wounded; the conduct of Major Queste and his officers and men under his command is worthy of all praise, as are the officers and rank and file of the 5th Corps and the Faxinal Squadron, without whose courage and enthusiasm to advance on the enemy we would have suffered some setback because not only did the enemy attack with over one hundred men, but due to the superiority of their cavalry and the bad condition of our horses I did not finish off the last rebel, Captain Francisco Cabeleira. I left the men under his command to protect the cavalry and even to observe the crossing; the two officers who died were married and poor, and I hope that Your Excellency, August Emperor, will see fit to grant the salary of their husbands who so often risked their lives in defense of the throne of His Majesty the Emperor; I am withdrawing along the coast of the Lagoa dos Patos to disperse the meetings that Bento Gonçalves is no doubt organizing to attack me when strayed.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency\n\nChapel of Sorrows, January 29, 1842.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Conde do Rio Pardo,\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Commander of the Expedition"
