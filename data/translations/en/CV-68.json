  "translation": "In compliance with the orders I received from Your Excellency on the 20th of this month, I crossed São Gonçalo with the force I brought from Porto Alegre, and Major Antunes with twenty men, including some officers, and Captain Lucas with two comrades who offered to join me; and since the news was circulating that Neto was already waiting for me with more than a thousand men, I requested from the Excellency of Rio Grande the 8th Battalion to leave at a supporting point so that I could assess the force, as I could not find a single man to serve as a firefighter; and marching towards the chapel of Canguçu, where Bento Gonçalves was with over two hundred men and several senior officers of the Republic, despite my efforts, I could not penetrate without being detected due to the densely populated terrain and all the farrapos; as soon as Bento Gonçalves learned of my march towards that settlement, he gathered everything and began to retreat; seeing that I could do nothing since he was already alerted and my cavalry was in very poor condition, I decided to feed my men and rest the horses, sending the 8th Battalion, which I had left to support at Ricardo's brickworks, back to the Liscano crossing and recalled Major Antunes and Captain Lucas with the troops they had brought, and I started my retreat, showing great fear and apprehension of Bento Gonçalves and Neto, marching all night and into the early morning, and on the morning of the 24th, I was overtaken by Bento Gonçalves in the paths of Guatimim; leaving an ambush in the rear to assess the force, I saw a large force approaching in said paths; I lost one soldier killed and one mortally wounded in that scouting; I retreated again to see if I could gauge the number of the force and as I did not see Rio Grande, I advanced Captain Isaías with over fifty men to gather horses on the left bank of Camaquã to see if something could be done since my cavalry did not give me the courage to undertake anything; as dawn broke at Camaquã crossing in Mendonça, I noted that the enemy was cautious as they had left part of their cavalry behind; I crossed Camaquã to this side, indicating to the locals that I was coming with great fear of Neto, causing them to spread the word that I was coming in the rear, and at around 6 PM I began my retreat; as soon as it got dark, I sent the cavalry with 60 men to Cordeiro crossing and I, with the remaining force, turned back and ambushed myself near that crossing, ambushing the infantry under the command of Major Queste in the path, instructing him to let pass between 150 and 200 men and fire at the rear so that I could charge from the front; as soon as on the morning of the 26th, Bento Gonçalves set out down the path of said crossing, Major Queste, allowing the indicated force to pass, fired at them from the rear, but as it had rained all night and the weapons were wet, they managed to cross to the other side leaving 5 dead and nearly forty saddled horses. Seeing that they were forming on the other side, I ordered the infantry to advance and I crossed with the cavalry behind; seeing that I was not advancing with more than two hundred cavalrymen, Bento Gonçalves tried to attack me and as soon as he saw me separate from the infantry, he charged with over three hundred men; but his numerical superiority did not help, as he was completely defeated, leaving on the field 31 dead and twenty prisoners, including a lieutenant-colonel and a lieutenant, among the dead, and two hundred horses, of which over eighty were saddled, many of them Captain Antônio Cândido da Silva and the brave Alferes Pedro Antônio Iripi and the valiant Sergeant Antônio Correia who were killed in combat, and seven soldiers were wounded, four severely and three lightly, two of whom were infantrymen wounded seriously; the conduct of Major Queste and his officers and men under his command is worthy of all praise, just as are the officers and lower ranks of the 5th Corps and the Squadron of Faxinal, for if it were not for the courage and enthusiasm with which they all advanced against the enemy, we would have suffered some setback because not only did the enemy attack with over a hundred men but due to the superiority of the cavalry, owing to the poor condition of our horses, I could not finish off the last rebel; Captain Francisco Cabeleira, with his command, was left to protect the cavalry and even for observation at the crossing; the two officers who died were married and poor and I hope that Your Excellency, Augustus Emperor, will see if he can grant the pay of their husbands who risked their lives so many times in defense of Your Majesty Emperor's throne; I am retreating along the coast of Patos Lagoon to dissolve the gatherings that must already be taking place on orders from Bento Gonçalves to attack me when I am waylaid."
