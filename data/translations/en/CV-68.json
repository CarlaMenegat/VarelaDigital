  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn compliance with the orders I received from Your Excellency on the 20th of this month, I crossed São Gonçalo with the force I brought from Porto Alegre and Major Antunes with twenty men, including some officers, and Captain Lucas with two comrades who offered themselves to go out; and as news spread that Neto was already waiting for me with more than a thousand men, I requested from the Most Excellent Rio Grande the 8th Battalion to leave at a support point so that I could reconnoiter the force, since I did not find a single man for the fire brigade; and advancing towards the chapel of Canguçu, where Bento Gonçalves was with over two hundred men and some senior officers of the Republic, despite all efforts, it was not possible for me to break through without being detected due to the very populated terrain and all parties being ragged; as soon as Bento Gonçalves received news of my march towards that town, he gathered everyone and retreated; seeing that I could do nothing as he was already prepared and my cavalry was very poor, I arranged to feed my men and rest the horses, ordering the 8th Battalion, which I had left in support at Ricardo's pottery, to withdraw to the Liscano ford and to send back Major Antunes and Captain Lucas with the men they brought, and as I withdrew, showing much fear and apprehension of Bento Gonçalves and Neto, marching all night and at dawn, on the dawn of the 24th Bento Gonçalves caught up with me on the Guatimim trails; leaving an ambush in the rear to reconnoiter the force, a large enemy force was seen coming along said trails; I lost one soldier dead and one mortally wounded during this reconnaissance; I withdrew again to see if I could adjust the number of the force, and as I found no Arroio Grande, I sent Captain Isaías forward with more than fifty men to gather horses on the left bank of Camaquã to see if something could be done, since my cavalry gave me no courage to undertake anything; dawn breaking at the Mendonça ford of Camaquã, I noticed the enemy came cautiously because they had left part of their cavalry behind; I crossed to this side of Camaquã, making the locals believe I was very afraid of Neto, who they spread out to say was in the rear, and at 6 o’clock in the evening I withdrew; as it got dark, I sent the cavalry with 60 men to the Cordeiro ford and with the main force I counter-marched back and, ambushing near the said ford, I caused the infantry under the command of Major Queste to ambush along the trail, instructing him to let 150 to 200 men pass and then fire on their rear so that I could charge from the front; in the early dawn of the 26th Bento Gonçalves marched along the trail of said ford, Major Queste letting the indicated force pass, fired on their rear, but as it had rained all night and the weapons were wet, they managed to cross to the other side again, leaving 5 dead and nearly forty saddled horses. Seeing that they had formed on the other side, I sent the infantry forward and crossed with the cavalry behind; seeing Bento Gonçalves that I did not cross with more than two hundred cavalrymen, he sought to attack me, and as soon as he saw me separate from the infantry, he charged with more than three hundred men; but superior numbers did not help him as he was completely defeated, leaving 31 dead and twenty prisoners on the field, including one lieutenant-colonel and one lieutenant, these among the dead, and two hundred horses, more than eighty of them saddled, many Captain Antônio Cândido da Silva and the brave Ensign Pedro Antônio Iripi and the valiant Sergeant Antônio Correia who were immortalized in the combat, and seven wounded soldiers, four seriously and three lightly, two of the infantry being seriously wounded; the conduct displayed by Major Queste and his officers and men under his command is worthy of all praise, as well as the officers and enlisted men of the 5th Corps and the Faxinal Squadron, who, were it not for the courage and enthusiasm with which all advanced on the enemy, we would have suffered some setback, because not only did the enemy attack with more than a hundred men but also because of the superiority of their cavalry that, due to the poor condition of our horses, I could not finish off the last rebel; Captain Francisco Cabeleira with his men I left to protect the cavalry and also to observe the ford; the two officers who died were married and poor, and I hope that Your Excellency, August Emperor, will see fit to grant the salary of their husbands, who so often risked their lives in defense of His Majesty the Emperor’s throne; I am withdrawing along the coast of Lagoa dos Patos to disperse the gatherings that are surely being organized by order of Bento Gonçalves to attack me when lost.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency\n\nCapela das Dores, January 29, 1842\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir, Count of Rio Pardo\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu\n\nLieutenant-Colonel, Commander of the Expedition"
