  "translation": "I received your appreciated letter with that emotion you may judge, and, first of all, I ask you to abandon the project of coming here, because perhaps very soon I will be restored to you, according to well-founded hopes. It was not fear of crimes, nor a lack of courage and resignation, that moved me to part from my family facing the discomforts of the sea: it was rather to see if, in this way, the public outrage that has been declared against me would concentrate within the limits of reason and, finally, in the calm of passions, would view me as a victim of concerns, etc., etc. It would be too unjust of me to harbor a desire for revenge or the slightest bitterness against anyone because of my imprisonment: I was indicted as an accomplice of a faction, appearances confirmed it; it was thought that my influence was harmful, and that my imprisonment became indispensable for the peace of many; this was done: and nothing could be more prudent. Now, would it be useful for me to appear suddenly again? No; thus, if I fervently vote for the tranquility of my fellow citizens, why should I hesitate in leaving the province? Yes, by my leaving, you yourself remain in greater tranquility; and does my wife not deserve all my sacrifices to make her existence less burdensome? Here, dear Sir Commander Luís Alves dos Santos Marques, in a way that evokes my most vivid gratitude, decide whether my journey is advisable or not, until the circumstances of our Province improve, and I can rush into your arms. Bernardina, take comfort: I still live for you and our children; and how many unfortunate souls, with these movements, must have already lost their existence? Revolutions are worse than volcanoes, and the people who endure them suffer greatly.\n\nPlease send me tomorrow by boat the small box of inks, which is in the office, the iron box, which was left on the table in our room, a fine comb, the penknife, 100 tongues, and a barrel of Chaves' meat, and in the letters you write to me address them to either Senhor Israel Soares de Paiva or Senhor Luís Alves dos Santos Marques, commander of the schooner \"October 19.\""
