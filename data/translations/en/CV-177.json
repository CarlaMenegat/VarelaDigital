  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart. Bordo, October 11, 1835, at 7 in the morning.\n\nI received your valuable letter with the emotion you can imagine, and, above all, I beg you to abandon the plan of coming here, because I may soon be returned to you, according to well-founded hopes. It was not fear of crimes, nor a lack of courage and resignation, that moved me to separate myself from my family braving the inconveniences of the sea: it was rather to see if in this way the public indignation, which has been expressed against me, could be confined within the limits of reason and finally, in the calm of passions, have that same public look upon me as a victim of concerns, etc., etc. It would be too unjust for me to harbor vengeance, or the slightest rancor against anyone on account of my imprisonment: I was accused as an accomplice of a faction, appearances confirmed it; it was thought that my influence was harmful, and that my imprisonment became indispensable for the peace of many; this was done: and nothing more prudent. Now, would it be useful for me to suddenly appear again? No; thus, if I myself ardently wish for the tranquility of my fellow citizens, why should I hesitate to leave the province? Yes, by leaving, you yourself will remain in greater tranquility; and would not my wife deserve from me all sacrifices to make her existence lighter? Here is, Madam, Senhor Comandante Luís Alves dos Santos Marques in a manner that brings forth my deepest gratitude, and decides whether or not my journey is right, until the circumstances of our Province improve, at which point I will run to your arms. Bernardina, take heart: I still live for you and for our children; and how many unfortunate ones, with these movements, have already lost their lives? Revolutions are worse than volcanoes, and the people who suffer them feel it.\n\nSend me tomorrow by the boat the little box of paints, which is in the office, the iron ones, which remained on top of the table in our room, a fine comb, the penknife, 100 tongues, and a barrel of Chaves' meat, and in the letters you write to me address them to Senhor Israel Soares de Paiva or to Senhor Luís Alves dos Santos Marques, commander of the schooner “19 de outubro.”\n\nHugs to our children and all our family, and receive the anguished heart of your husband, who loves you very much, Almeida.\n\nI do not know if bedding has come for me.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
