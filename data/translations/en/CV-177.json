  "translation": "My dear wife of my heart. Bordo, October 11, 1835, at 7 in the morning.\n\nI received your dear letter with that emotion of which you can judge, and, first of all, I beg you to desist from the plan of coming here, because perhaps very soon I shall be restored to you, according to well-founded hopes. It was not fear of crimes, nor less courage and resignation, that moved me to separate from my family enduring the hardships of the sea: it is indeed to see if in this way the public indignation, which has been declared against me, would be concentrated within the limits of reason and, finally, in the calmness of passions, that same public might look on me as a victim of concerns, etc., etc. It would be too unjust if I harbored vengeance, or the slightest rancor against anyone, because of my imprisonment: I was accused as an accomplice of a faction, appearances confirmed it; it was thought that my influence was harmful, and that my imprisonment became indispensable for the peace of many; this was done: and nothing is more prudent. Now, would it be useful for me to appear again suddenly? No; therefore, if I myself ardently vote for the tranquility of my fellow citizens, why should I hesitate to leave the province? Yes, by leaving, you yourself will remain in greater peace; and will not my wife deserve from me all the sacrifices to make her existence less burdensome? Here, Senhor Commander Luís Alves dos Santos Marques in a manner that draws from me the deepest gratitude, and determines whether or not my journey is right, until the circumstances of our Province improve, I run to your arms. Bernardina, comfort yourself: I still live for you and for our children; and how many wretches, with these movements, must have already lost their existence? Revolutions are worse than volcanoes, and the people who suffer them are affected.\n\nSend me tomorrow by the boat the little box of paints, which is in the office, the iron ones, which remained on the table in our room, a fine comb, the penknife, 100 tongues and a barrel of Chaves’ meat, and in the letters you write me put as addressee Senhor Israel Soares de Paiva or Senhor Luís Alves dos Santos Marques, commander of the schooner “19 de outubro.”\n\nRegards to our children and all our people, and receive the anguished heart of Your husband, who loves you very much, Almeida.\n\nI do not know if any bedding came to me.\n\nSenhora Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
