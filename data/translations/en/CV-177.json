  "translation": "My dear beloved wife. Bordo, October 11, 1835, at 7 o’clock in the morning.\n\nI received your precious letter with the emotion you can imagine, and first of all, I beg you to abandon the plan of coming here, because I may be restored to you very soon, according to well-founded hopes. It was not fear of crime, nor lack of courage and resignation, that moved me to leave my family by braving the inconveniences of the sea: it was indeed to see if in this way the public indignation, which has been declared against me, would concentrate within the limits of reason and finally, in the calm of passions, would see me as a victim of worries, etc., etc. It would be too unjust if I breathed vengeance, or the slightest rancor against anyone, because of my imprisonment: I was accused as an accomplice of a faction, appearances confirmed it; it was thought that my influence was harmful, and that my imprisonment was indispensable for the peace of many; this was done: and nothing more prudent. Now, would it be useful for me to suddenly appear again? No; therefore, if I myself ardently wish for the tranquility of my fellow citizens, why should I hesitate to leave the province? Yes, by leaving, you yourself will remain in greater tranquility; and will not my wife deserve from me all sacrifices to make her existence less burdensome? Here is, Lady Senhor Luís Alves dos Santos Marques in a manner that elicits my deepest gratitude, and decides whether or not my journey is wise, until the circumstances of our Province improve and I run to your arms. Bernardina, comfort yourself: I still live for you and for our children; and how many unhappy ones, with these movements, have already lost their existence? Revolutions are worse than volcanoes, and the people who endure them suffer.\n\nSend me tomorrow by the boat the little box of paints that is in the office, the iron ones that stayed on top of the table in our room, a fine comb, the penknife, 100 sheets of paper, and a barrel of the meat from Chaves, and in the letters you write me, address them to Senhor Israel Soares de Paiva or Senhor Luís Alves dos Santos Marques, commander of the schooner “19 de outubro.”\n\nHugs to our children and to all our people, and receive the anguished heart of your husband, who loves you dearly. Almeida.\n\nI do not know if any bedding has come to me.\n\nLady Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida. Pelotas."
