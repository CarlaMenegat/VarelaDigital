  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nOn the 23rd of the current month, I left the Picada camp at 6 o'clock in the evening with 40 cavalrymen of the 5th Corps under my command on a reconnaissance of the enemy; and traveling the entire night, crossing the Boa Vista farm, I reached the banks of the arroio dos Ratos; and harassing there a police guard, I selected four men from it whom I brought to serve in the 5th Corps under my command; and there I discovered among some huts on some quite difficult hills, a smithy of a blacksmith officer named Veríssimo, who with all diligence was making spears for the rebels, ordered by their adjutant-general, Joaquim Pedro; and with the said blacksmith escaping through the woods, I caused such smithy factory to disappear and be rendered useless, after which I withdrew, bringing 30 tame horses that I captured and some cattle to refresh the detachment, returning to the Picada camp at 5 o'clock in the evening of the 24th of the current month without any loss to my men.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency\nPorto Alegre, January 25, 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Brigadeer Filipe Neri de Oliveira, Most Worthy Commander of the 2nd Brigade.  \n(a) Francisco Pedro de Abreu, Lieutenant-Colonel.  \nCopies were sent to the Presidents and the General Commander-in-Chief."
