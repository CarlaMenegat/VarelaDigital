  "translation": "On the 23rd of this month, I left the camp at Picada at 6 o'clock in the evening with 40 cavalry soldiers from the 5th Corps of my command to scout the enemy. Marching all night, passing through the Boa Vista estate, I reached the bank of the arroio dos Ratos; and while ambushing a police guard there, I selected four men whom I brought to serve in the 5th Corps of my command. There, I discovered among some bushes on difficult hills a smithy belonging to an officer named Veríssimo, who was diligently making lances for the rebels ordered by their quartermaster, Joaquim Pedro. After the smith escaped into the bush, I made that smithy disappear and rendered it useless. After that, I retreated, bringing 30 tame horses that I captured and some cattle for the refreshment of the detachment, returning to the camp at Picada at 5 o'clock in the afternoon on the 24th of this month without any loss among my men.\n\nGod preserve Your Excellency Porto Alegre, January 25, 1840."
