  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nOn the 23rd of this month, I left the Picada camp at 6 in the evening with 40 cavalrymen from the 5th Corps under my command in search of the enemy and traveling throughout the night, crossing the Boa Vista farm, I reached the banks of the Arroio dos Ratos; and harassing a police guard there, I selected four men from it who I brought to serve in the 5th Corps under my command; and there I discovered among some huts on some very difficult hills, a smithy belonging to a blacksmith officer named Veríssimo, who with all diligence was making spears for the rebels ordered by their adjutant-general, Joaquim Pedro; and as the said blacksmith escaped through the bushes, I caused the disappearance and rendered useless such a smithy factory, after which I withdrew, bringing back 30 tame horses that I captured and some cattle for the refreshment of the detachment, returning to the Picada camp at 5 in the afternoon of the 24th of the current month without any casualties among my men.\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nPorto Alegre, January 25, 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir  \nBrigadier Filipe Neri de Oliveira,  \nMost Worthy Commander of the 2nd Brigade.  \n(a) Francisco Pedro de Abreu.  \nLieutenant-Colonel.  \n\nCopies were sent to the Presidents and the General Commander-in-Chief."
