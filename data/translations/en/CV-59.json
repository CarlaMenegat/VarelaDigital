  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nOn the 23rd of the current month, I left the camp at Picada at 6 o’clock in the evening with 40 cavalrymen from the 5th Corps under my command in search of the enemy, and traveling throughout the entire night, crossing the Boa Vista farm, I reached the bank of the arroio dos Ratos; and attacking there a police guard, I selected four men from them whom I brought to serve in the 5th Corps under my command; and there I discovered among some small huts on very rough hills a forge belonging to a blacksmith officer named Veríssimo, who was diligently making lances for the rebels, ordered by their adjutant-general, Joaquim Pedro; and as the said blacksmith escaped through the woods, I caused such a forge to disappear and be rendered useless, after which I withdrew, bringing with me 30 tame horses that I caught and some cattle for the refreshment of the detachment, returning to the camp at Picada at 5 o’clock in the afternoon of the 24th of the current month without any loss to my men.\n\nMay God keep Your Excellency  \nPorto Alegre, January 25, 1840.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir  \nBrigadier Filipe Neri de Oliveira,  \nWorthy Commander of the 2nd Brigade.  \n(a) Francisco Pedro de Abreu,  \nLieutenant Colonel.  \nCopies were sent to the President and the General Commander-in-Chief."
