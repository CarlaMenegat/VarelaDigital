  "translation": "Military Guard of the Police, Part of the Commander of the Police.\n\nCamilo Maria de Meneses, former justice of the peace of São Gabriel, who was hiding in this city in a house on Clara Street, was arrested and taken to the 8th Battalion of Hunters by order of Your Excellency, for the crime of anarchism.\n\nThis Camilo was arrested by Bento Manuel and sent to the town of São Borja, not only for having been the leader of a rebellion in São Gabriel against the cause of legality, but also, being the justice of the peace of that town, on October 4, 1836, he forced Captain Paula of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment to hand over the uniform, armament, and one year’s worth of ammunition belonging to said regiment, which the said Captain Paula did; and all of this was distributed by order of the aforementioned Camilo to the people under the command of the anarchist Corte Real, and some things were sold in Cruz Alta by his order, thus becoming, for this reason, a thief of the National Treasury.\n\nIt was this Camilo, while imprisoned along with others in the town of São Borja last year, who seduced Captain Fabiano Pires de Almeida, Major Boaventura Soares, Lieutenant Colonel Domingos da Silva, and Lieutenants Terêncio of some surname and Matias (whose surname I do not recall), to give the cry of the Republic in that town; and being informed of this procedure, Lieutenant Colonel Manuel dos Santos Loureiro ordered his subordinate Fabiano Pires de Almeida to send him to the town of Cruz Alta, as Rio Pardo can inform the justice of the peace of that town, and I understand he sent them to this capital, where they were released; and all of this should be recorded in the Government Secretariat, which at the time was Lieutenant General Francisco das Chagas Santos, or in any other court of this city, and the witnesses to some of these pointed facts are the Municipal Judge of the town of Cruz Alta Bernardino José Lopes and Captain Francisco José Anjo and Captain Cláudio, adjutant of this place.\n\nI have not sent to Your Excellency.\n\nBarracks of the Military Guard of the Police in Porto Alegre square, December 31, 1837. José Antônio Ferreira Adrião, Lieutenant Commander of the Police.\n\nCertified correct. Antônio Félix Lobo. Major Graduate and Secretary of the Command of Arms."
