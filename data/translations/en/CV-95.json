  "translation": "Military Police Guard, Part of the Police Commander.\n\nWas arrested and taken to the 8th Battalion of Hunters, under the order of Your Excellency Camilo Maria de Meneses, former justice of the peace of São Gabriel, who was hiding in this city, in a house on Clara Street, for the crime of being an anarchist.\n\nThis Camilo was arrested by Bento Manuel and sent to the town of São Borja, not only for being the ringleader of a rebellion in São Gabriel against the cause of legality, but also, being justice of the peace of that town, in October 1836, on the fourth day, he forced Captain Paula, of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, to hand over the uniform, armament, and the one-year's worth of ammunition belonging to said regiment, which Captain Paula did; and all this was distributed by order of the said Camilo, to the people under the command of the anarchist Corte Real, and some items were sold in Cruz Alta by his order, thus becoming, for this reason, a thief of the National Treasury.\n\nIt was this Camilo, who, while being arrested, along with others, in the town of São Borja last year, seduced Captain Fabiano Pires de Almeida, Major Boaventura Soares, Lieutenant-Colonel Domingos da Silva, and Lieutenants Terêncio such and Matias, whose surname I cannot recall, in order to give the cry of the Republic in that town; and upon being informed of this behavior, Lieutenant-Colonel Manuel dos Santos Loureiro ordered his immediate subordinate Fabiano Pires de Almeida to send him to the town of Cruz Alta, as Rio Pardo could inform the justice of the peace of that town, who, as I understand, sent them to this capital, where they were released; and all of this should be recorded in the Government Secretariat, which at the time was Lieutenant-General Francisco das Chagas Santos, or in any other court of this city, and the witnesses to some of these mentioned facts are the Municipal Judge of the town of Cruz Alta Bernardino José Lopes and Captain Francisco José Anjo and Captain Cláudio, adjutant of this place.\n\nI did not send to Your Excellency\n\nBarracks of the Military Police Guard in the square of Porto Alegre, December 31, 1837. José Antônio Ferreira Adrião, Lieutenant Commander of the Police.\n\nCertified as true. Antônio Félix Lobo. Senior Major and Secretary of the Arms Command."
