  "translation": "He was arrested and taken to the 8th Battalion of Hunters, at the order of Your Excellency Camilo Maria de Meneses, former justice of the peace of São Gabriel, who was hidden in this city, in a house on Clara Street, for the crime of anarchism.\n\nThis Camilo was arrested by Bento Manuel and sent to the town of São Borja, not only for having been the leader of the rebellion in São Gabriel against the cause of legality, but also, being the justice of the peace of that settlement, on October 4, 1836, he forced Captain Paula of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment to deliver to him the uniform, armament, and one year's worth of ammunition belonging to said regiment, which Captain Paula did; and all of this was distributed at the command of the aforementioned Camilo, by the people under the leadership of the anarchist Corte Real, and some items were sold in Cruz Alta by his order, thus becoming, for this reason, a thief of the National Treasury.\n\nIt was this Camilo who, while imprisoned with others in the town of São Borja last year, seduced Captain Fabiano Pires de Almeida, Major Boaventura Soares, Lieutenant Colonel Domingos da Silva, and Lieutenants Terêncio of such and Matias, whose surname I do not recall, in order to give the cry of the Republic in that town; and being informed of this conduct, Lieutenant Colonel Manuel dos Santos Loureiro ordered his subordinate Fabiano Pires de Almeida to send him to the town of Cruz Alta, as Rio Pardo can inform the justice of the peace of that town, who I understand sent them to this capital, where they were released; and all of this should be recorded in the Government Secretariat, which at that time was Lieutenant General Francisco das Chagas Santos, or in some other court of this city, and the witnesses of some of these noted facts are the Municipal Judge of the town of Cruz Alta Bernardino José Lopes and Captain Francisco José Anjo and Captain Cláudio, aide of this quarter.\n\nI did not send to Your Excellency."
