  "translation": "Military Police Guard, Part of the Police Commander.\n\nCamilo Maria de Meneses, former justice of the peace of São Gabriel, who was hiding in this city in a house on Clara street, was arrested and brought to the 8th Battalion of Hunters by order of Your Excellency, for the crime of anarchism.\n\nThis Camilo was arrested by Bento Manuel and sent to the town of São Borja, not only for having been the leader of a rebellion in São Gabriel against the cause of legality, but also, being the justice of the peace of that village, on October 4, 1836, he forced Captain Paula, of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, to deliver to him the uniform, armament, and one year's supply of ammunition belonging to said regiment, which Captain Paula complied with; and all this was distributed by order of the aforementioned Camilo among the men under the command of the anarchist Corte Real, and some items were sold in Cruz Alta by his order, thus becoming, for this reason, a thief of the National Treasury.\n\nIt was this Camilo, who, while imprisoned along with others in the town of São Borja last year, seduced Captain Fabiano Pires de Almeida, Major Boaventura Soares, Lieutenant Colonel Domingos da Silva, and Lieutenants Terêncio such and Matias, whose surname I do not recall, to give the cry of the Republic in that town; and upon being informed of this action, Lieutenant Colonel Manuel dos Santos Loureiro ordered his subordinate Fabiano Pires de Almeida to send him to the town of Cruz Alta, as Rio Pardo could inform the justice of the peace of that town, and it is known to me that they were sent to this capital, where they were released; and all this should be recorded in the Government Secretariat, which at that time was under Lieutenant General Francisco das Chagas Santos, or in any other court of this city, and the witnesses to some of these pointed facts are the Municipal Judge of the town of Cruz Alta Bernardino José Lopes, Captain Francisco José Anjo, and Captain Cláudio, adjutant of this plaza.\n\nI have not sent this to Your Excellency.\n\nBarracks of the Military Police Guard in the square of Porto Alegre, December 31, 1837. José Antônio Ferreira Adrião, Lieutenant Commander of the Police.\n\nIt is in accordance. Antônio Félix Lobo. Senior Major and Secretary of the Arms Command."
