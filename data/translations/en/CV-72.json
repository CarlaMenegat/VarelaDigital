  "translation": "I report to Your Excellency the Most Honorable Sir Piratini, I have received news that Neto was in Piratini with a contingent of 50 men preparing for a grand celebration on September 20; many races tied; a wintering of a thousand horses; Castilho and Major Correia with one hundred and fifty men in a corner above the Camaquã. Having the Most Honorable Sir Rio Grande, I wrote to him providing part of the news, and if he wished to strike a blow at the enemy, it seemed that this raid would be very advantageous, but it was necessary to bring the barge no. 2 of horses that was in Rio Grande and one or two steamers; I sent another firefighter to come to me on the 8th of this month and I was preparing for the expedition; when the firefighter arrived on the 8th of this month, bringing me the same news of the great preparations for the celebration and the races, and that a lot of officers had gathered, and that besides the wintering horses, it was still possible to gather nearly a thousand horses from the neighbors; and as the Most Honorable Sir Rio Grande didn’t reply to my report, I communicated to the Most Honorable Sir the Most Honorable Sir the Most Honorable Sir the Most Honorable Sir 1st Brigade of Cavalry; despite all my efforts and having managed to already embark three hundred and so many cavalry men, ninety horses on two barges, and forty Germans of infantry, ready to march that same night, such were the fears of complications that this most important operation failed, having to return that same night of the 16th of this month with my men and horses already from Porto Alegre to my camp. Therefore, if Your Excellency\n\nResponded on October 1, 1840.\n\nOffice to the Commander of the Garrison of the Capital on the same day.\n\nOffices to the Government and to the President on the same day."
