  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency Most Excellent Sir Piratini, that I have received news that Neto was in Piratini with a picket of 50 men preparing for a great celebration on September 20; many herds tied up; a winter stock of one thousand horses; Castilho and Major Correia with one hundred and fifty men in a ranch on the Camaquã. Having written to the Most Excellent Sir Rio Grande, notifying him of the news, and if he wished to strike the enemy, it seemed to be of great advantage to make this move, but it was necessary to bring the number 2 boat with horses that was in Rio Grande and one or two steamers; I sent another dispatch to come to me on the 8th of the current month and began preparing for the expedition; the dispatcher arrived on the 8th of the same month, bringing the same news of great preparations for the celebration and the herds, that many officers were gathering, and that besides the horses in the winter stock, nearly one thousand horses could still be gathered from the neighbors; and as the Most Excellent Sir Rio Grande neither replied to my message, I communicated to the Most Excellent Sir Most Excellent Sir Most Excellent Sir Most Excellent Sir 1st Cavalry Brigade; despite all my efforts and having already managed to embark three hundred and some cavalrymen, ninety horses on two boats and forty German infantry, ready to march on that very night, such fears of compromise arose that this most important operation was frustrated, having to return on the very night of the 16th of the current month with my men and horses already from Porto Alegre to my camp. Therefore, if Your Excellency Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency \n\nCamp at Ponta Rasa, September 17, 1842.\n\nFrancisco Pedro de Abreu\n\nSee Conde de Rio Pardo 12-1-42.\n\nAnswered on October 1, 1840. Dispatch to the Commander of the Garrison of the Capital on the same day. Dispatches to the Government and to the President on the same day."
