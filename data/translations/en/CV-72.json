Having the Most Excellent Sir Rio Grande, I wrote to him giving him knowledge of the news, and if he wished a strike to be given to the enemy, which seemed to be very advantageous this ambush, but it was necessary to bring the boat no. 2 of horses that was in Rio Grande and one or two steamers; I sent another messenger to come to me on the 8th of this month and I was preparing for the expedition; the messenger arrived on the 8th of this month, giving me the same news of the great preparations for the celebration and the herds, and that many officers were gathering, and that besides the horses of the winter stock there could still be gathered nearly a thousand horses from the neighbors; and since the Most Excellent Sir Rio Grande did not even reply to my communication, I informed the Most Excellent Sir Most Excellent Sir Most Excellent Sir Most Excellent Sir 1st Cavalry Brigade; despite all my efforts and having already managed to embark three hundred and some cavalrymen, ninety horses on two boats and forty German infantrymen, ready to march that same night, such were the fears of compromisation that this most important operation was thwarted, having to return that same night of the 16th of this month with my men and horses already from Porto Alegre to my camp.
