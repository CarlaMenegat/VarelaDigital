  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nI inform Your Excellency, Most Excellent Sir, Piratini brought me the news that Neto was in Piratini with a piket of 50 men preparing for a great celebration on September 20th; many teams harnessed; a herd of a thousand horses; Castilho and Major Correia with one hundred and fifty men in a small farm on the Camaquã. Having the Most Excellent Lord of Rio Grande, I wrote to him giving part of the news, and if he wished, a strike could be given to the enemy, which seemed to be very advantageous, but it was necessary for the second boat of horses that was in Rio Grande and one or two steamers to arrive; I sent another courier to come to me on the 8th of the current month and I was preparing for the expedition; when the courier arrived on the 8th of the current month, giving me the same news of the great preparations for the celebration and the teams, and that many officers were gathering, and that besides the horses of the herds, nearly a thousand horses could still be gathered from the neighbors; and as the Most Excellent Sir of Rio Grande did not even give me an answer to my report, I communicated to the Most Excellent, Most Excellent, Most Excellent, Most Excellent First Cavalry Brigade; despite all my efforts and having already managed to embark three hundred and some cavalrymen, ninety horses in two boats and forty German infantry, ready to march that same night, such were the fears of compromission that this very important operation was frustrated, having to return that same night of the 16th of the current month with my men and cavalry already from Porto Alegre to my camp. Therefore, if Your Excellency, Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Camp at Ponta Rasa, September 17, 1842. Francisco Pedro de Abrew\n\nSee Conde de Rio Pardo 12-1-42.\n\nAnswered on October 1, 1840. Official letter to the Commander of the Garrison of the Capital on the same day. Official letters to the Government and the President on the same day."
