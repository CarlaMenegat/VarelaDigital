  "translation": "Surely Your Excellency Colonel Lebério must be preparing to receive your orders, and I understand that the government may be taking action, so I hope for Your Excellency, Your Excellency, Your Excellency.\n\nI had written to you from São Gabriel regarding this matter, and that letter is in the possession of Mrs. José Mariano's godmother, and if it weren’t for the reasons that occurred, I certainly would not have taken such a step without the deliberation of Your Excellency.\n\nThe health of Your Excellency.\n\nIllustrious Excellency Mr. Domingos José de Almeida. Alegrete.\n\nReceived and responded on August 28, 1840."
