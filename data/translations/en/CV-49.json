  "translation": "Yesterday, Cruz came by and said that Bento Manuel went to Piratini and the supplies to Rio Pardo, and in Triunfo, Captain Augusto is gathered with everyone—old people, children, and the disabled—having 160 cavalrymen and 40 infantry under the command of Felisberto, brother of Simas. They say they will retreat within six or eight days. The departure of the supplies to Rio Pardo is confirmed by Furriel José João de Castro, who was a prisoner at Rio Pardo and came back yesterday from Santo Amaro; and Your Excellency, Major Simas and Mombaque, if you wish, you can also go for Oliveira's men. Cruz is ready and waiting for the orders to proceed; that is all I have to inform Your Excellency for now."
