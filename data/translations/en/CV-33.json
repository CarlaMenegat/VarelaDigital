  "translation": "Piratini, October 31, 1841.\n\nThis letter is solely to inquire about your health and that of my comadre. On the 24th of the current month, I wrote to you by mail, and I believe it would have been delivered; there is no news here, only that a letter for the Lord has arrived, which they say is from Rio Grande, carried by a Barbosa from Passo das Pedras.\n\nIt was also said that the camels were in Pelotas; however, as far as I know, there is no one here yet; it is true that at the chapel of the Thieves, a group appeared, and according to reports, they caught two young men, one of whom is said to be a son of a Macedo, and they claim they joined the infantry.\n\nYour comadre sends her best regards to Your Excellency.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Sir Domingos José de Almeida. Most Worthy Bagé.\n\nAnswered on November 5, 1841."
