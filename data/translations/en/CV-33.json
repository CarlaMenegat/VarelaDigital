  "translation": "Most esteemed godfather, friend, and gentleman,\n\nPiratini, October 31, 1841.\n\nThis letter has solely the purpose of inquiring about your health and that of my godmother. On the 24th of this month I wrote to you by mail and I believe it would have been delivered; there is no news here, only a letter appeared addressed to you which they say came from Rio Grande, brought by a Barbosa from Passo das Pedras.\n\nIt was also said that the camels were in Pelotas, however, according to what is known, no one has come here yet; it is true that a party appeared near the Chapel of the Thieves and, according to what is said, they caught two young men, among them a son of a Macedo, who they say enlisted in the infantry.\n\nYour godmother sends her regards to Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency's godfather and very grateful friend, Antônio José de Abreu.\n\nTo the Most Illustrious and Exalted Sir Domingos José de Almeida, Most Worthy of Bagé.\n\nAnswered on November 5, 1841."
