  "translation": "Most esteemed godfather, friend, and lord,\n\nPiratini, October 31, 1841.\n\nThis letter has solely the purpose of inquiring about your health and that of my godmother. On the 24th of this month, I wrote to you by post and I think it would have been delivered; there is no news here, only a letter appeared here for you which is said to have come from Rio Grande, carried by a Barbosa, from Passo das Pedras.\n\nIt was also said that the camels were in Pelotas but, according to reports, no one has arrived here yet; it is true that through the Chapel of the Thieves a party appeared and, they say, took two young men, one among them the son of a Macedo, who are said to have enlisted in the infantry.\n\nYour godmother sends her best regards to Your Excellency.\n\nFrom Your Excellency’s godfather and grateful friend,  \nAntônio José de Abreu\n\nMost illustrious and excellent Senhor Domingos José de Almeida.  \nMost worthy Bagé.\n\nAnswered on November 5, 1841."
