  "translation": "Colonel Agostinho asks me, in a letter written in great haste, to inform Your Excellency Captain Lima that on the morning of the 5th, Lieutenant Colonel Aranha was attacked near the Lara estate by an enemy force, leaving Lima devastated, escaping with 2 more officers and 8 soldiers, with Lieutenant Saraiva being taken prisoner and others killed; and as the colonel, due to this movement, believes that Lieutenant Colonel Aranha has been defeated, and that communication has been cut off from that side, he marched to regroup in Botucaraí, given that it is likely that the prisoners would confess to the small force left at Passo Fundo; and Captain Lima claims that Candinho and the emigrants were the ones who defeated him.\n\nIn the attached letter, Your Excellency will see Rio Pardo, further affirming to Your Excellency."
