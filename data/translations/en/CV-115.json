  "translation": "Most Illustrious Excellent Sir\n\nColonel Agostinho asks me, in a letter written in great haste, to inform Your Excellency Captain Lima, to join Lieutenant-Colonel Aranha, on the morning of the 5th he was attacked near the Lara estate by an enemy force, leaving Lima himself shattered, escaping with 2 other officers and 8 soldiers, Lieutenant Saraiva and others were taken prisoner and others killed; and as the colonel believes that with this movement, not only was Lieutenant-Colonel Aranha defeated, but also that communication was cut off on that side, he marched to assemble at Botucaraí, seeing it probable that the prisoners would confess the small force left at Passo Fundo; and Captain Lima affirms that it was Candinho with the immigrants who defeated them.\n\nBy the attached letter Your Excellency will see Rio Pardo, further affirming to Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency  \nVila da Cruz Alta, December 7, 1839.  \nMost Illustrious Excellent Sir Bento Manuel Ribeiro.  \nRicardo Antônio de Melo e Albuquerque.\n\nFrom the Sir"
