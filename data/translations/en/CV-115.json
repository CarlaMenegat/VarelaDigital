  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nColonel Agostinho asks me, in a letter written with great haste, to inform Your Excellency that Captain Lima, having joined Lieutenant Colonel Aranha, on the morning of the 5th was attacked near the Lara estate by an enemy force, leaving Lima completely shattered, escaping with 2 other officers and 8 soldiers, while Lieutenant Saraiva and others were taken prisoner or killed; and as the colonel, due to this movement, not only believes that Lieutenant Colonel Aranha was defeated, but also estimates that the communication line is cut in that area, he marched to regroup at Botucaraí, considering it probable that the prisoners would confess the small force left at Passo Fundo; and the same Captain Lima states that Candinho with the emigrants were the ones who defeated him.\n\nBy the attached letter Your Excellency will see Rio Pardo, further asserting to Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Vila da Cruz Alta, December 7, 1839. Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir Bento Manuel Ribeiro.\n\nRicardo Antônio de Melo e Albuquerque.\n\nFrom the Sir"
