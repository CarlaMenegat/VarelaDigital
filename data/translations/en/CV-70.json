  "translation": "According to the orders and instructions of Your Excellency from April 29, on the third of the current month, I moved to the right bank of the Jacuhí, and that same afternoon, with 370 cavalrymen and 84 infantrymen from the Company of German Engaged, also mounted, I proceeded to the Serra do Erval, with the aim of cutting off the enemy's retreat, who had part of his forces on this side of the Camaquã. After three nights of cautious marching, I reached the place called Tavares, where I captured José Gonçalves da Silva, brother of Bento Gonçalves, titled chief of the republic, who held the position of Justice of the Peace in this faction. There I learned that the rebel forces had already crossed to the right bank of the Camaquã. I proceeded without delay to the Chapel of São João Lemos, all prisoners by Alferes Fidélis Pais da Silva, from the 5th Cavalry Corps. Seeing the hasty flight of the anarchists, I instructed Lieutenant Colonel João Frederico Caldwell, who with the forces under his command was to cross the Camaquã and march towards the estate of Malaquias, where he was to support my movements while I crossed the same river at the Mendonça ford.\n\nOn the same day, everything was carried out with the utmost caution and speed, heading to the chapel of Boqueirão, where I joined with the detachments I had sent to various locations, and had it not been for a heavy fog that lasted until 10 o'clock in the morning, I would have surprised more than 200 rebel men, nonetheless taking over 300 good horses from them. Seeing that the enemy had a significant advantage in his retreat, and that I had advanced more than 40 leagues, with vigorous marches, having to make a long retreat without finding more cavalry to gather, I decided to join forces with Lieutenant Colonel Caldwell on the 13th, and marching together to a place called the Cordilheira, there we separated, with that lieutenant colonel moving to Rio Pardo, and I to the Cerro do Roque, reaching the bank of the Jacuhí at Ponta Rasa on the 22nd, without any other news.\n\nFrom that place, I immediately sent the 6 prisoners to this capital; securing the cavalry well, I promptly sent the forces by Your Excellency Jacuí. Thus, I report to Your Excellency."
