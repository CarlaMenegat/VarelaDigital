  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir\n\nIn accordance with the orders and instructions of Your Excellency of April 29th, I crossed on the third of the current month to the right bank of the Jacuhí, and that same afternoon, with 370 cavalrymen and 84 infantrymen from the Company of German Engaged, also mounted, I proceeded to the Serra do Erval, with the aim of cutting off the retreat of the enemy who was positioned with part of his forces on this side of the Camaquã. After three nights of the most cautious marching, I arrived at the pasture lands called Tavares where I captured José Gonçalves da Silva, brother of Bento Gonçalves, titled chief of the republic, who in this faction exercised the role of Justice of the Peace. There I learned that the rebel forces had already crossed to the right bank of the Camaquã. I proceeded without delay to the Chapel of São João Lemos, all prisoners taken by Ensign Fidélis Pais da Silva, of the 5th Cavalry Corps. In view of the hasty flight of the anarchists, I sent word to Lieutenant-Colonel João Frederico Caldwell, that with the forces under his command he should cross the Camaquã and march toward the Malaquias estate, where he was to support my movements, while I crossed the same river at the Mendonça ford.\n\nOn the same day, the 9th, everything was carried out with the greatest caution and speed, proceeding to the chapel of Boqueirão, where I joined with the detachments I had sent to various places, and had it not been for a heavy fog that lasted until 10 o'clock in the morning, I would have surprised more than 200 rebel men, taking from them however more than 300 good horses. Seeing that the enemy was gaining great advantage in his retreat, and that I had advanced more than 40 leagues, with violent marches, having to make a long withdrawal without finding more horses to gather, I determined to join forces with those of Lieutenant-Colonel Caldwell on the 13th, and marching together to the place called Cordilheira, there we parted ways, that lieutenant-colonel proceeding to Rio Pardo, and I to the hill of Roque, arriving at the bank of the Jacuí at Ponta Rasa on the 22nd, without any other news.\n\nFrom that place I immediately sent the six prisoners to this capital; placing the horses in good guard, I immediately sent the forces by Your Excellency Jacuí. In this manner I report to Your Excellency Your Excellency\n\nGod keep Your Excellency Loyal and Valiant City of Porto Alegre, May 24, 1842. Most Illustrious and Excellent Count of Rio Pardo\n\nDraft"
