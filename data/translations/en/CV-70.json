  "translation": "Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir,\n\nIn accordance with the orders and instructions of Your Excellency on the 29th of April, I crossed on the third day of the current month to the right bank of the Jacuhí, and that same afternoon, with 370 cavalry troops and 84 infantry from the Company of German Engaged Soldiers, also mounted, I proceeded to the Erval mountain, with the purpose of cutting off the retreat of the enemy, who was with part of his forces on this side of the Camaquã. After three nights of the most cautious march, I reached the Tavares fields where I captured José Gonçalves da Silva, brother of Bento Gonçalves, designated chief of the republic, who in this party served as Justice of the Peace. There I learned that the rebel forces had already crossed to the right bank of the Camaquã. Without delay, I proceeded to the Chapel of São João Lemos, all prisoners under Ensign Fidélis Pais da Silva, of the 5th Cavalry Corps. In view of the precipitate flight of the anarchists, I sent word to Lieutenant Colonel João Frederico Caldwell, who with the forces under his command was to cross the Camaquã marching towards the Malaquias ranch, where he was to support my movements while I crossed the same river at the Mendonça ford.\n\nOn the same day, the 9th, everything was carried out with the greatest caution and speed, moving towards the Boqueirão chapel, where I joined the detachments that I had sent to various places, and if it were not for a heavy fog that lasted until 10 in the morning, I would have surprised more than 200 rebel men, nevertheless capturing more than 300 fine horses from them. Seeing that the enemy was gaining a great advantage in his retreat, and that I had advanced more than 40 leagues with violent marches, having to make a long withdrawal without finding more horses to gather, I decided to join forces with Lieutenant Colonel Caldwell on the 13th, and marching together to the place called the Cordilheira, there we separated, he heading to Rio Pardo, and I to the Roque hill, arriving at the bank of the Jacuí at Ponta Rasa on the 22nd, without any further incident.\n\nFrom that place, I immediately sent the six prisoners to this capital; placing the horses in good guard, I promptly ordered the forces through Your Excellency Jacuí. Thus I report to Your Excellency.\n\nMay God preserve Your Excellency.\n\nLoyal and Valiant City of Porto Alegre, 24 May 1842.\n\nMost Illustrious and Excellent Count of Rio Pardo\n\nDraft"
