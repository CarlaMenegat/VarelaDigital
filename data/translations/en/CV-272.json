  "translation": "Dear Rossetti Piratini, December 10, 1838.\n\nAlthough I am expecting you here, as José Mariano da Cunha told me, yet this may not be true, I write to you to say that I have received your latest letters, including the communications.\n\nTo your compatriot Carline, I gave 30 patacões, 20 to the first officer and 30 to the second: this kind of people are not very easy to please. The engineers and artillerymen have behaved in a manner that is incompatible with defenders of principles; they think we swim in gold. It is not easy to find many Zambeccaris, Rossettis, and Garibaldis.\n\nIf you do not arrive within these eight days, I will then write at length. My eldest girl is at death’s door; I am desperate and burdened with work beyond my strength, and you and others want me to break down! In short, let us fulfill fate.\n\nRegards to Cuneo, to Castellini, and you receive the heart of Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Luís Rossetti. From Domingos José de Almeida."
