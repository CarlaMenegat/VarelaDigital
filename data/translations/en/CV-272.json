  "translation": "Although you are waiting for me here, as José Mariano da Cunha affirmed, this may not be true, I write to tell you that I have received your latest communications, including the correspondence.\n\nI gave 30 patacões to your countryman Carline, 20 to the first master, and 30 to the second: this class of people is not very easy to please. Mr. Engineer and Artilleryman have behaved in a way that is not compatible with defenders of principles; they think we swim in gold. It is not easy to find many Zambeccaris, Rossettis, and Garibaldis.\n\nIf you do not arrive within these eight days, I will be very extensive then. My oldest girl is at death’s door; I am desperate and burdened with work beyond my strength, and you and others wanting me to burst! Anyway, let us fulfill our fate."
