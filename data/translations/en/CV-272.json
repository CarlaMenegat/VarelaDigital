  "translation": "Dear Rossetti Piratini, December 10, 1838.\n\nAlthough I am expecting you here, as José Mariano da Cunha has informed me, nevertheless, since that may not be true, I write to tell you that I have received your latest letters, including the communications.\n\nTo your compatriot Carline I gave 30 patacões, 20 to the first proper one and 30 to the second: this sort of people is not very easy to satisfy. The Engineers and Artillerymen have behaved in a way that does not accord with defenders of principles; they think we swim in gold. It is not easy to find many Zambeccaris, Rossettis, and Garibaldis.\n\nIf you do not arrive within these eight days, I shall then be long-winded. My eldest girl is at death’s door; I am desperate and with a burden of work beyond my strength, and you and others wanting me to break down! In short, let us fulfill fate.\n\nRegards to Cuneo, to Castellini, and you receive the heart of Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Luís Rossetti. From Domingos José de Almeida."
