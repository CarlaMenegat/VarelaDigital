  "translation": "Dear Rossetti Piratini, December 10, 1838.\n\nAlthough I am waiting for you here, as José Mariano da Cunha informed me, and this may not be true, I write to you to say that I have received your latest letters, including the communications.\n\nTo your compatriot Carline I gave 30 patacões, 20 to the first proper one and 30 to the second: this kind of people are not easily satisfied. The Engineers and Artillerymen have behaved in a way that does not accord with defenders of principles; they think we swim in gold. It is not easy to find many Zambeccaris, Rossettis, and Garibaldis.\n\nIf you do not arrive within these eight days, I will then be extensive. My eldest girl is dying; I am desperate and burdened with work beyond my strength, and you and others want me to burst! At last, let us fulfill fate.\n\nRegards to Cuneo, to Castellini, and you receive the heart of Domingos José de Almeida.\n\nMost Illustrious Sir Luís Rossetti. From Domingos José de Almeida."
