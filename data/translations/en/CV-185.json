  "translation": "My dear wife, Norte, December 29, 1835.\n\nBeing unable to follow on the boat, because the President has appointed today at noon to meet with the Commission of the Provincial Assembly, of which I am a part, I write you this letter so that you do not worry about me. Perhaps I may leave today in a boat, if after the conference I have time for that; but this is uncertain.\n\nHugs to all our loved ones and goodbye until then, Your husband at heart, Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida — Pelotas."
