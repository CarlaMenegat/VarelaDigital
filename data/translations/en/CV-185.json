  "translation": "Not being able to follow in the boat, as the President has designated noon today to meet with the Provincial Assembly Commission, of which I am a part, I am sending you this letter so that you do not worry about me. Perhaps today I will take a small boat, if there is time for that after the conference; but this is uncertain."
