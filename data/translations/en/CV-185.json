  "translation": "My beloved wife Norte, December 29, 1835.\n\nUnable to travel by boat, as the President has scheduled today at noon to meet with the Commission of the Provincial Assembly, of which I am a part, I write to you so that you do not worry about me. Perhaps I will even leave today in a small boat, if after the conference there is time for it; but this is uncertain.\n\nHugs to all our loved ones and goodbye until then, Your beloved husband Almeida.\n\nMrs. Bernardina Barcelos de Almeida — Pelotas."
