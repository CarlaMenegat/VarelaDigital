  "translation": "Citizen Collector, Tax Offices of the municipalities of Jaguarão, Piratini, and Pelotas.\n\nSince the State is debtor to Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu of the sum that will be legally shown to you, I order you to admit for him bills of exchange on the effects of his property that he wishes to dispatch at this Tax Office; the said bills must be issued with a sufficient term for Abreu himself to have time to apply to the government for the discount of the rights he intends to obtain. Any bill that he may have already issued, and that is possibly nearing maturity, may be reformed while Abreu himself does not obtain from the government the order he seeks, or its payment by any other means; which I expect. Thus you shall comply.\n\nBento Gonçalves da Silva\n\nIt is in agreement. Hilário Amaro Júnior\n\nAnnex to document CV-6.\n\nNa"
