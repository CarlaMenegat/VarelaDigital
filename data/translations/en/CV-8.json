  "translation": "Citizen Collector, Collectories of the municipalities of Jaguarão, Piratini, and Pelotas.\n\nThe State being debtor to Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu of the amount that it will legally show you, I order you to admit to him bills of the effects of his property that he wishes to dispatch at this Collectory; said bills must be issued with a sufficient term to allow Abreu the time to request from the government the discount of the rights he intends to obtain. Any bill already issued by him and which may be about to mature can be reformed until the same Abreu obtains from the government the order he desires, or its payment in any other manner; which I expect. Thus fulfill it.\n\nBento Gonçalves da Silva\n\nIt is in accordance. Hilário Amaro Júnior\n\nAttached to document CV-6.\n\nNa"
