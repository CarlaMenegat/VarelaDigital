  "translation": "Being the State debtor to Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu the amount that you will legally show, I order you to accept from him promissory notes of the effects of his property that he wishes to dispatch in this Collector's Office; the said notes must be issued with a sufficient term for Mr. Abreu to have time to request from the government the discount of the rights he intends to obtain. Any note that he has already issued, and that may be due, can be reformed while Mr. Abreu does not obtain from the government the order he intends, or his payment, in any other way; which I hope for. Thus, comply with it."
