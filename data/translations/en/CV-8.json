  "translation": "Citizen Collector, Collection Offices of the municipalities of Jaguarão, Piratini, and Pelotas.\n\nSince the State is debtor to Antônio Francisco dos Santos Abreu of the amount that will be legally shown to you, I order you to admit him bills of exchange of the effects of his property which he wishes to dispatch at this Collection Office; the said bills must be issued with a sufficient term for Abreu himself to have time to request from the government the discount of the rights he intends to obtain. Any bill of exchange already issued by him and which may be about to mature can be reformed as long as Abreu has not obtained from the government the order he intends, or its payment, by any other means; which I expect. Thus you shall comply.\n\nBento Gonçalves da Silva\n\nIt is in accordance. Hilário Amaro Júnior\n\nAttached to document CV-6.\n\nNa"
